    "So far, all of the analysis we've done has been pretty generic - looking at counts, creating scatter plots, etc. These techniques could be applied to numeric data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to text data, there are a few popular techniques that we'll be going through in the next few notebooks, starting with sentiment analysis. A few key points to remember with sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
    "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
    "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on how TextBlob coded up its [sentiment function](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/).\n",

Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming.\\nUm… It’s a very exciting day for me. It’s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I’m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “Fuck you.” “Fuck you. I don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘Cause I’m straight up jealous. I’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through.\\nAnd then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don’t have insomnia yet. They don’t know what it’s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don’t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It’s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It’s coming. You don’t have HPV yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? That’s what that says about you. A lot of men don’t know that they have HPV, because it’s undetectable in men. It’s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “Boo!” in women’s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We’ll find out.\\nUm, I can also tell that I’m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I’m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I’m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That’s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I’m a horrible person, I’m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don’t ever do that with your mom. It was\",\n",
       "  ' like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “You never know when you might need this.” And I was like, “But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.”\\nI grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I’m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, “Oh, my God, who is that?” And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m gonna trap his ass.” “Going to trap his ass!” And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, “All right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” When, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to… It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… We had so much chemistry. He was like, “Hey, wassup?” I was like, “Wassup?” And we– The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, “Hey, can you drop me off?” I was like, “Where?” He was like, “At the park.” And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, “Oh, no!” “I just fucked a homeless dude! Again!”\\nMy husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It’s… too much. I don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… And then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. I’m, like, “I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonize',\n",
       "  'r!” You know?\\nBut I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don’t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It’s… amazing. It’s what love is built on, you know?\\nMy last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, “Hold it. You guys aren’t Mexican?” Asian-American men are very underrated. I don’t know why people don’t go for them. They’re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It’s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “I did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “This is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.” And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That’s where the umami flavor comes from.\\nI think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we’re both half-fancy Asian… …and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It’s… It’s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn’t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, “It’s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!” I was like, “It’s not authentic, OK?” You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused.\\nI grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it’s funny, right, because he’s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We’re like, “Oh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house.\\nHim and I had been dating for four years and I– I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women’s intuition. That’s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. First passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you’re like, “I’m just g',\n",
       "  'onna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “Shut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?” And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, “Oh, my God! He proposed!” “It came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something… that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.” Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page… he’s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday… because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That’s how rotten I was.\\nPeople are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I’m a completely different person. You– Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I’ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t. I straight up don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she’s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don’t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “We’re dumb women. We don’t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.” “‘Cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” And then, all these women had to show off and be like, “We could do it! We could do anything.” “Bitch, shut up!” “Don’t tell them the secret.” They ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, “Double-income household,” I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they’re like, “But, Ali, we have so many more options now.” Oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it?\\nA lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. And they’ll be like, “Look at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.” I’m like, “That bitch is a genius.” “She’s not a housewife, she’s retired.”\\nI do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is… It’s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don’t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don’t gotta do that. They don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfire',\n",
       "  \"d ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you’re like, “Oh, no! Courtney’s listening. She’s waiting. She’s timing me.” And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want.\\nYou know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “You need to get to work on time.” I was like, “You need to eat bananas.” “I saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.”\\nMy father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, “Hey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” I was like, “Why you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don’t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, ‘I do,’ what I really meant was, ‘Oh, I’m done.'” I’m done. I don’t wanna work anymore and I’m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That’s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just… Let’s redecorate.\\nI gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I’m a– I’m a disgusting pervert. I’m a pervert. I’m a gross filthy animal. And I think it’s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you.\\nI broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, “Uh, you’re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist… and posted ‘Tiny Asian female seeking anal…’ the Internet would crash.” “And all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. And they’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna do that. I’m scared of– of the pain.” You ain’t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You’re not scared of the pain. What you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can’t help you now. But don’t worry, ’cause when he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “I just put it in her butt.” “I gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.” You’re– If you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta cha\",\n",
       "  'nge it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, “Oh, my God! It’s like I’m going back in time!”\\n♪ A whole new world ♪\\nIt was magical.\\nA big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to… Now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your– Just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You’ll get a lot of “No! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don’t– No! I don’t! I don’t! No!” They get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. They’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. And it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know?\\nMy husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When– When I’ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. “Hey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?” I’m, like, “Yes, I know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. OK?” ‘Cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their– Glasses always means the woman wants some– It’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, “I don’t wanna die! Don’t kill me! I don’t wanna die!” But I also don’t want to be sure that I’m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just– Just choke me enough so that I can’t talk. ‘Cause if I can talk, I’m gonna tell you what to do. And I’m tired of being the boss. I’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I’m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it.\\nSheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, “You’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “You have executive leadership skills.” Which is a very roundabout way of saying: “You’re a little cunt.”\\nI’m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I’m talking about? I’m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That’s the kind of income bracket I’m striving for. That’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango… …Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess.\\nI have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran.\\nSo, I don’t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There’s– None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That’s not the ',\n",
       "  'case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “Guys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby’s a little piece of shit. It’s so annoying and boring.” And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “That’s hilarious. I identify.” And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. She’s busy. So, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, “Ali, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become– You’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the dream.” That’s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know?\\nAnother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “Why are you gonna have a kid? Why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” Which he’s definitely gonna before me. Because I’m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I’m a billion. I’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” Well, Asian don’t die. We don’t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we’re such bad drivers? Because we’re trying to die. We’re like, “Yeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!” “Imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “I’m gonna make a right turn– I changed my mind, it’s a U-turn!” “I changed my mind again. It’s a O-turn!” Every time I get into a car accident… …I’m like, “Oh, my God, not again!” I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m still here, you know?\\nI need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It’s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, “I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” They do that ’cause it’s a free activity. For them. They do it in their– their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity.\\nI also decided to have a kid because uh, I’m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it– And it scared me. Like, I’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It’s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my G',\n",
       "  \"od, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!”\\nI don’t know what kind of mother I’m gonna be. I’m– I’m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that… is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. “Uh, mmm.” They watch Property Brothers, scratch, “What’s crackin’? Mmm.” Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “When can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. If it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD.\\nWhen my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “Oh, my God, that’s so hot. You guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” No, dude. That’s– That’s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in– When you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. It tells you when it’s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, “We’re not fuckin’. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘Release the Kraken!'” And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I’d be like, “OK, it’s go time,” and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “Please, hurry the fuck up.” And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… And then, because we’re hippies, I’d be like, “Hey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?” And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That’s right. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore.\\nI’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last \",\n",
       "  'year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They’re like, “Oh, my God. That’s so dark and terrible. I can’t believe that.” I’m 33. Girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It’s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom– She’s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, “Uh, yeah. Where I’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. It’s whatevs, OK?” And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, “Oh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” And I was like, “No!” And then she said, “But what I don’t see is a heartbeat.” And I was like, “Yes!” “The Lord is mysterious!” Don’t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, “You look.” “You watch the whole thing.” And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyoncé. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That’s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted.\\nI’m scared about giving childbirth, though. I’m– I’m very, very scared of childbirth. That’s why I’m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser Söze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “Ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” I was like, “Yeah, I look forward to it.” I’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can’t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That’s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “Hey, can you wash the dishes?” “No!” “Can you water the plants?” “I am not doing jack shit anymore. I’m busy makin’ a eyeball, OK? Are you makin’ a foot? I didn’t think so. You change the channel.”\\nI can already see how there’s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “Oh, my God. I can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. He is so supportive.” Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I’m the star of the show. There’s nothing for the camera to see if I’m not there. But he’s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I’m a bad mommy.\\nYou know, I– I– I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I’m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that they get dark s',\n",
       "  'o that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. Like, “You, you. You owe me money, you.” My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it.\\nNow that I’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. But it’s different. It’s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, “Why is it different?” And I looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That’s not the same. When it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s Neosporin.\\nSo, you know, I– I, in– previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron’d my ass. And now, if I don’t work, we die. Why else do you think I’m performing seven and a half months pregnant?\\nAll right, I’ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody.

Please, thank you. LA!\\n[audience cheering]\\nDon’t make me like you. Oh, my God, there’s, like, some young people up front. Like how… how old are you?\\n[woman] Twenty-seven.\\n[Amy] Twenty-seven. Oh… remember?\\n[audience laughing]\\nRemember 27? [sighs] God, you’re so cute and everything’s still up high and… You’re wearing heels. You’re gonna… Someday, you’re gonna… These are gonna be your heels. Okay?\\n[audience laughing]\\nRight here. To me, these are heels now. Okay? There’s an orthopedic insert in here.\\nWhat’s your name?\\n[woman] Libby.\\n“Libby.” That’s so cute. Twenty-seven. Libby. Oh, my God. Do you drink? Are you a drinker? Little bit? Okay. Here’s the kind of drinking I’ve been doing lately, okay, on this tour. Like, yesterday is the only day I didn’t drink, and I drank. Do you know what I mean?\\n[audience laughing]\\n[Amy] You know? You don’t count it ’cause it was less than five. Started early, yeah. So I don’t count that, yeah. ‘Cause I, uh… I used to black out, Libby. Last week. And, uh… Nothing good ever happens in a black-out, right? I’ve never woken up, like, “What is this Pilates mat doing out? Wow.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Who cleaned?” No. No. Wake up with a potato skin like an eye patch. Dried ice cream on my neck. I hope!\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience whistling]\\n[Amy] Can’t drink like we used to, huh? I just turned 40. Again.\\n[audience cheering]\\nThank you. Thank you. Keep doing it. Keep doing it. And, uh, you know, I’ve always preached confidence for women. You know, to feel great in your own skin. Right? And then the day I turned 40, I took my skin and I got it lasered. Hm…\\n[audience laughing]\\n[Amy] So, Libby, what laser is… is they shoot a laser at your face. Okay, you pay them money, a lot of money, and in return they shoot you in the face with a laser beam. The thing that in the Ocean’s Eleven bank heist movies, they’re trying to avoid to get the money. You, instead, put your face in front of them. It’s incredible what laser does. What happens is… you turn blood-red, but then the skin falls off your face. But then, six-to-eight weeks later… you look exactly the same.\\n[audience laughing and applauding]\\n[Amy] Amazing, right? It’s just incredible what they can do now. Just… I got filler in my face. Uh, then they dissolved it, ’cause, as it turns out, I was already full. I… [chuckles] Tom… Tom, you’re doing “A” cam, right',\n",
       "  \"? Can you get in close on this in case people don’t know? So, my face… Someone, just because they were wearing a white lab coat, talked me into needing more volume up here. Okay? It already looks like I’m storing nuts for the winter. [makes munching sound] I came home, scared the shit out of my husband. Just bleeding. Just needle marks. He’s like, “Holy fuck, were you in a fire?”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI’m like, “I wasn’t not in a fire.” “Wait until my laser kicks in, babe. You’re gonna be hard as a rock.” I got lipo, and then I, in record time, gained the weight back. Lipo is the laziest thing I’ve personally ever done. That was my way of saying, “I would rather have major surgery… than be a little hungry once.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat’s the truth. I’m never hungry. I never let it get to that, you know? I feel it coming about an hour away and that’s when I combat it. You know? You know, I’m doing my best. I had a baby. Not bad for a year. Right?\\n[audience cheering]\\nIt’s been three.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd a half. But, uh… You ever get handed a new insecurity when you weren’t really expecting it? Someone will just kinda mosey up and hit you with it. They’ll just… “Hey, you know who you look like?” I go, “No, thanks.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“I’m not open to that feedback right now. Thank you.” It’s never somebody good, right? It’s never a model. It’s always, like, their fucked-up cousin. “Look!” [sighs] I just got handed a new insecurity by a trusted friend. It’s when you’re feeling safe that someone will hit you with something they thought you’d already accepted about yourself. You know, she goes, “You know how you’re short-waisted?” I was like, “Yes! What?”\\n[audience laughing]\\nShe’s like, “You know the way your ass goes all the way to your armpit, and you don’t really…” “Like an ostrich! Cool! Okay, good! Good!” “I love that!” But I just got hit with a new insecurity that rocked me. I was getting acupuncture to see if I could still feel, and, uh… He’s working on me, and with so much enthusiasm, like it wasn’t a big deal, he says to me, “Did you know that you have a hump?”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI said, “My lovely lady lumps?”\\n[audience cheering]\\n“Check it out!” Right? He’s like, “No, you have a hump.” And I do. I’ll show you. On the back of my neck, okay, don’t miss out on this shot, Tom. Get in here. Okay? Check that out. I… Someone goes, “Oh, yeah!” Yes, I do. I’m humped, okay. Like a whale, or a camel. Or that guy who loves Notre-Dame. I… found out in my 40s that all this time I’ve been rocking a hump. I said, “What do we do?” He goes, “I don’t think there’s anything we can do.” “So you just needed me to know?” He goes, “It’s called a ‘widow’s hump.'” I’m like, “I’m all set with info about that. Thank you.” He said, “Well, just try holding your neck back further.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Like this?” He said, “Yeah, that’s good.” “Okay, yeah. Less hump. Is this…?” So, I know a lot of you are sitting there thinking, “Do I have a hump?” And… I don’t want you to be shy. You’re a little em… Just feel free. Just go in there and feel. The way you’ll know, is when you run your finger down your neck, you’ll run into a hump.\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo that’s my little secret insecurity. Okay? I’m humped. We all have some little secret insecurity, right? Like… I just met someone, and I don’t think their insecurity can be a secret. Okay,\",\n",
       "  ' now, this story really happened. Okay? My husband and I were invited to a dinner party. Very last minute. We think we were a last-minute fill-in. Not a big deal. We go to the party, and it was at this really rich guy’s house. We never met him before. Right before we go in, our friend who invited us says, “Oh, just so you know, he’s blind, but it’s a secret.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI’m like, “What the fuck are you talking about?” “From who?” She’s like, “Well, um, he doesn’t acknowledge it, and everyone around him acts like it’s not happening.” I’m like, “You can be that rich that you’re just not blind?” Turns out, yeah. So… I was glad she gave me a heads-up, you know, ’cause, like, I have no impulse control. In ten seconds in his house, I would have been like, “Are you fucking blind?” I was glad she gave me a heads-up, ’cause… Sometimes people give you a heads-up for things that aren’t necessary, and it makes everything awkward. You know? Someone will be, like, “Okay, and he’s Black.” “Should I change the music?” What are you talking about? You don’t have to warn me about, you know… Or, “And she’s gay.” “Oh, should I eat her out?”\\n“Is that…?”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s a weird warning, but, uh… But, “He’s blind and it’s a secret”? Thank you. A “secret blind” is a heads-up I want. So… So we go in and… he’s blind. Okay? He’s in the kitchen, because he’s cooking. And you could tell… He’s looking up. He says, “Hey, great to meet you. No shaking hands. Covid.” And we’re like, “That’s why.”\\nUh…\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd he offers us a drink. I said, “Sure, yeah. Great.” So I went over to grab a glass, and I am not kidding you, I turn around, and he’s like this.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience clapping]\\nAll night, shit like this is happening. People just clean it up and act like it didn’t happen. Keep it moving. Dinner took nine years to cook. We’re all sitting around pretending to eat and, uh… I’m keeping the conversation going. I’m trying to fill the air, but I kept on talking about vision by accident. You don’t realize how much you talk about it, you know. I… I actually said this sentence, okay, to a blind person. I said, “Is anyone watching The Watcher?”\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhat? That’s a double-blind. I fucked up. His girlfriend was there. I said, “How long have you guys been seeing each other?” Fucking fuck. “Smelling her?” Um… This rich guy. In his late 50s. Had a very young girlfriend. Very young. I’m like, “Let me guess, she’s an old soul.” Right? Isn’t that the story, LA? Twenty-three-year-old pussy, but what an old soul on the gal. Wait until you get a load of her soul! Yeah. And I don’t think it’s cool to make fun of blind people. I just don’t think you can be a secret blind. Okay? And if there’s gonna be one group of people that’s really mad at me, that feels like a safe one.\\n[audience laughing]\\n“We’re gonna get you!” Are you?\\n[audience laughing]\\nI shouldn’t be baiting the crowd like this. I really shouldn’t. People ask, “Is this a dangerous time for comedians?” You know, I don’t know if you saw, Chappelle got tackled on-stage. And just all this crazy shit’s been happening. When they ask, I’m like, “Yes.” “I’m on the front lines every night.” Like, no. Not if you’re me, you know. Maybe if you’re them, you have these spry… I’m like, “My people are like me. Okay?” We’re tired.\\n[audience laughing]\\n[chuckles] Nobody’s',\n",
       "  ' tackling anybody. We’re all too tired. I don’t know about you, here’s where I am with my energy level lately. If I sit down and realize I didn’t grab the remote…\\n[audience laughing]\\nI’ll just sit there… for as long as it takes. Right? There’s one of us in every relationship. The piece of shit. Right? You just sit there. You wait for your partner to come in. “Hey, can you grab the remote?” It’s like, “Have you been sitting here for two hours?” Goes to sit down. “And also can you get me another drink? Oh.” What else is going on in my life? Oh, I have a little boy.\\n[audience cheering]\\nA little boy. Yeah. I don’t know if I’m a good parent. I think I’m just getting used to failing. Is that what being a parent is? Just… Just bombing. It’s like stand-up. You know, you just get used to it. I just… I don’t think anybody’s failed as hard as I did, as quickly, though. Do you know what I named my son? Let me walk you through it, okay? Listen up, Libby. So… Our son’s first name is Gene. Okay? Gene. Basic. We named him after my husband’s mom, who passed away, which is very sad, of course.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBut also, to not… have a mother-in-law…\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt sounds like somebody has a lucky hump. So… Very sad, of course. My husband’s last name is Fischer. That’s why I, Amy, didn’t take it.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s… You might be a little young for this reference, Libby, but… Google “Amy Fisher” when you get home. And, uh, it’s not good. So… Then came his middle name, and that’s… That’s where I fucked up. Okay? I, uh, I wanted to pay tribute to my favorite comedian, my good friend, Mr. Dave Attell. – All right. So I…\\n[small cheer]\\nThat’s about right. So I…\\n[audience laughing]\\nTruly my favorite comedian of all time. So we gave him the middle name “Attell.” So I was about a month into being a new mom, sitting on the couch when I realized that I’ve named my son… “Genital Fissure.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnybody ever fuck up like that? I don’t think so. We changed his middle name as soon as we realized. I think it’s better. We changed it to “Fingerbang Shit-Snatch.” Is that better? Or… Is anybody here pregnant? Any pregnant people here? Oh, congratulations. Are you keeping it?\\n[audience laughing]\\nHey, we’re in one of the states where we still have a choice. Right?\\n[audience cheering]\\nCan you believe it? In Wisconsin, I didn’t want to ask the crowd. You know? It’s, like, yeah. They could always drive to Illinois. Just recommending. But, uh… Yeah. People love giving pregnant women advice, don’t they? They love it. They just love it. The whole time I was pregnant, I have this one friend, she’d always tell me, She’s like, “You have to do prenatal yoga.” “It really helps with the birth. Prenatal yoga.” So I immediately signed up for a C-section.\\n[audience laughing]\\nBecause, fuck that, okay? If I’m ever in downward dog, I fell. Upward humpback Jew. That’s my resting pose, right here. I did. I had a… I had a C. Came out the sunroof. And, uh… You know, some women feel like they failed if they don’t give birth vaginally. And the only thing that really comforts me is my still-perfect pussy. It’s really…\\n[audience cheering]\\nNo, it’s not. It’s not good. Trust me. Things still shift, you know what I mean? I don’t… I don’t know what it is. When I take a bath, I feel like I fill up. You know? I just kinda… floating in there. Just… Just kin',\n",
       "  'd of squishing around after for hours. But they tell you, no matter how you give birth, C-section, vaginal… They almost never come out of your asshole.\\nThey tell you…\\n[audience laughing]\\nThe doctor is very serious right after you give birth. They say, “Now, listen, you cannot have sex for six weeks.” “Okay? No sex. Six weeks.” I’m like, “Okay, let me write that down. Six…” I’m like, “Oh, wait, remember when you just, uh, Wolverine’d my FUPA open?”\\n[audience laughing]\\nHow about six years? That’s when I think I’ll want to do that again. “His foot got caught on my intestines on the way out.” “When can I get raw-dogged from behind?” [chuckles] These… “I need dick!” Like, who’s…? “Five weeks?” Yeah, okay. I had this awful condition while I was pregnant called hyperemesis gravidarum. Severe nausea and vomiting, the whole pregnancy. I was so relieved when I was diagnosed, it was like six months in. I was like, “Okay, we know what it is. What do we do?” And they explained to me, “We haven’t been able to study it because it only happens to women.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience cheering]\\n“But if your husband wants, we have chewable Viagra.” Which is a real product. Because, sometimes, it’s scary to take a pill.\\n[audience laughing]\\n“I wanna get hard, but I don’t want to take a pill.”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience cheering]\\n“Okay, you can chew it. Okay.” I have severe endometriosis. Very painful. A debilitating disease. About 10% of women have that. There are no studies. But if your dick curves slightly one way, they got you, bro! Any dick-mergency, the Paw Patrol is on the way! Got a hysterectomy this year. Wanted to lose those last three pounds, am I right, ladies? [chuckles] No. I had to get it removed because of my endometriosis. And, uh… It was a big surgery. They took out my uterus, they found cysts in my ovaries. They found a tumor in my appendix. But the craziest thing they found was that my liver was fine.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s such a fun New York moment right after that surgery. I was walking around feeling sorry for myself, and there was this group of big meathead dudes. One of them recognized me and goes, “Hey! Amy Schumer!” “How you doing?” I was feeling kind of honest. You know, I was like, “Not great. I just had my uterus removed.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd his response made me feel so much better. He goes, “Oh, no!”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“You should get it back!” I’m like, “That’s not…” “That’s not really how that works, but thank you, sir.” I feel so much better after getting that surgery, the laparoscopy and all that. I, uh… If you have endometriosis… The only way I can describe how much better I feel, is like if you ever saw Willy Wonka, you know those old people that are all in that bed, 69-ing all day, like…\\n[audience laughing]\\n[moans] And the one grandpa gets the golden ticket and he gets out and clicks his heels. Like, that’s me. You know… That’s how much better I feel. I’m like a new person… I’m a new mom. You know, I can run with my son now. I don’t, but, uh… You know. I, uh… We had a medical emergency in the audience last weekend on the road. It was very strange. I learned a lot about my crowd. It was in the balcony. This guy was having a seizure. He’s fine. You know, I… I didn’t follow up. But I’m assuming, you know, I would have heard. No, he’s fine. But, uh… But in the moment it was scary. We had to turn the house l',\n",
       "  'ights on. This is when I learned about my crowd, because I was like, “We need a doctor! Go!” Not one.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThe entire audience, not one doctor. So I’m like, okay, “Nurses!” And there were like 40 nurses but they were all hammered.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThey’re like, “We’re not on-call. Fuck you!” I was like, “Fair.” Thank God for our nurses. You know?\\n[audience cheering]\\nYeah. Fuck yeah. I really couldn’t… couldn’t sleep after that. It was just… It was alarming, you know? It was like… I mean, I can never sleep anyway. I’m such a bad sleeper. Whenever I say that, somebody is like, “Have you tried melatonin?”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“CBD?” I’m like, “I need heroin, okay?” Fucking melatonin. Get outta here. I mean, they told us how we can get better sleep. We all know the advice, right? They said, “If you want the best night of sleep of your life, an hour before you go to bed, turn your phone off.” What do we all say? “No.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“That’s crazy.” “Oh, you don’t care about sleep?” I care about sleep more than anything in the world. I’ll take any pill, I’ll have any surgery. “Why not just 15 minutes before you go to bed, power down?” “Fuck you!”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI need to be staring into the abyss of my phone as I’m falling asleep, okay? Plus, I need to be reading something. I’m eating. [scoffs]\\n[audience laughing]\\nThey did do one study on women. You may have read about this. They found that social media is harmful to young girls. Thank you, NASA. We know. Right? Since we’ve been in town, I saw this group of girls, maybe 12 years old. These little girls were taking selfies. You know, and they knew their angles. Know what I’m saying? Maybe some people don’t know. Like… Like, your angles… Okay. Like, see how my leg looks if you look straight on? Get a shot of this, Tom. Look at that. Disgusting.\\n[audience laughing]\\nWhat is that, Gollum? That’s heinous. Now watch this. Bam! Whoa! Everyone’s hard.\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd they knew their good side, these 12-year-old girls. They see so many pictures of themselves. Like, I’m 41. I know my angles. Okay? At this point, the photographer gets in a tree, and I dig a deep trench. I kinda get down there… That’s me. That’s where I shine, you know? Twelve years old. Remember when we were 12? Somebody took a picture of us once a year.\\n[audience laughing]\\nRight? Maybe twice if we had a school dance. Right? Somebody’s dad had a camera. It was like, “Whoa! I didn’t know Lindsay was rich! Her dad has a whole camera!” We didn’t know our angles. They’d say, “Cheese!” And we’d all just kinda… [grunts] Looked like we were shitting ourselves. Because we were. Because all we ate was dairy. Right? We didn’t have oat milk, or almond milk, or Erewhon.\\n[audience laughing]\\nWe had whole milk. And we drank it with every meal. You’d have a grilled-cheese sandwich with a cup of milk. Our skin was bad, we were farting all over the place. It was disgusting. But we were happy, goddamn it.\\n[audience cheering]\\nRight? I don’t know, Libby. Twenty-seven. What would it be like to be 27 now? You grew up seeing so many more pictures of yourself. Here’s a good thing. You are definitely vaccinated for chicken pox. Probably don’t even know it. Remember our vaccine for chicken pox? Is that your mom would push you in a room…\\n[audience laughing]\\n…with neighbors who had them, just… [groans] She’d g',\n",
       "  \"o, “Get it!” That was our vaccine. “Go get it!” Horrifying. You’re definitely vaccinated for HPV. And I feel bad for you. You’re missing out on an important character-building experience.\\n[audience laughing]\\nWe all had it. All my friends, we all got it. Admitted it to each other after college. We’re all crying. “I’m a whore!” [mock crying] “I’m gonna have to tell all my future partners!” Never told one person. [mock crying] We all got it. I’m still really close with my girls from high school. I feel so lucky about that friendship. Yeah. It’s the best. I realized though… that we text each other like we’re fucking. Like, I text them in this intimate way I would never text my husband. You know? I’ll be like… “Text me the second you’re home safe.” “Home.” “Thank God.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Your ass in those jeans tonight, what?” “When can we be together again?” If Chris ever got a text like that from me, he’d think I was fucking kidnapped. He’d call the police. I was out drinking with my girlfriends one night. And, uh… We were talking about how lazy we’ve gotten, sexually. And, uh, I was like, “What if we text all of our husbands ‘Do you want to have phone sex right now?'” We were crying we were laughing so hard. We thought… We thought it was so funny. And we did it, and we got such different responses from these dudes. My husband wrote back the fastest, okay, and he just wrote, “Fuck you.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nOkay. That’s fair. It’s what I deserve. You know? And my friend Jess’ husband, we declared the loser because he just wrote, “Too tired.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nWe’re such hypocrites. We were pissed. And then, uh… My friend Caroline’s husband said, uh, “When the kids go to bed.” Not bad. But the winner, we declared, was my friend Andrea’s husband, who just immediately called. Hello?\\n[audience laughing]\\nJoke was on her. She had to have phone sex with her husband that night. She answered like she was in a horror film. “Hello?” I love my girls. They’re all teachers and nurses from Long Island. and they, uh… Yeah. Teachers.\\n[audience cheering]\\nHoly shit. Thank you, teachers. They came with me when I hosted the Oscars. They were on the red carpet with me, and it was… It was so fun having them there. And they were so excited. At first.\\n[audience laughing]\\nJust… We just get used to shit so quick, don’t we? These girls, at first they’re so starstruck. They’re like, [gasps] “There’s Ryan Reynolds!” And, “Is that Taylor Swift?” And then 20 minutes later, my friend Jess walks over smoking a cigarette. She’s like, “Meryl Streep’s chatty.”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\n[exhales] This bitch. You know? I love my girls. We all got married. I can’t believe we got married. We, uh… All of us. I’ve only been married for five years, but this is what I think marriage is so far. I think marriage is finding someone who can stand you.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIs that too romantic? Find someone who can fucking stand you. Especially during the pandemic when we were all just home, just… Staring at each other. Judging. Waiting to criticize each other. “You gonna chew like that?”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“No. No.” “Didn’t know if you’re trying to wake the neighbors ’cause it’s so loud. But no.” My husband… We were fighting… What was our last fight? Oh, we went to see Top Gun. Anybody see Top Gun?\\n[audience cheering]\\nIt was cute, right? I was impressed. Do you know\",\n",
       "  ' that Tom Cruise does all his own Scientology?\\n[audience laughing]\\nI dragged him there. I wanted to see it in the theater. You know, we were fighting. I don’t remember what about. I remember I was right. But, uh… But… This is why I like being married because it’s, you know, he said, “I don’t even want to be near you right now.” Before we were married, I would have been like… But I’m like, “Can I have your wallet? I still want to see Top Gun.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nKinda throws it to me. He leaves. I just walked to the movie. I’m like, “Fuck this guy. I’ll see him at home. [mutters] Half a block later, he’s back walking next to me. Gave him his wallet. We didn’t talk about it. Just moved on. Gotta keep it moving. Right? Keep it moving. But he can stand me. Do you guys know who Hilaria Baldwin is?\\n[audience laughing]\\nI’m saying it wrong. I’m sorry. [Spanish accent] Hilaria… Baldwin. [normal accent] Okay. So, I just can’t wrap my head around this story. If you don’t know who I mean, this is Alec Baldwin’s wife. Okay? And I met her years ago, backstage at SNL. Alec was like, “I want you to meet my wife.” And I saw her, and I said, “No, thank you.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI’m trying to hang on to my self-esteem. Okay? She is a tiny Disney princess, and I… look like Ben Roethlisberger from most angles. She came over. [Spanish accent] “I’m Hilaria from Espania.” [normal accent] Very thick Spanish accent. Okay? From Spain. You might have seen her on a morning show doing a cooking demonstration where she had trouble remembering how to pronounce the word [Spanish accent] “How you say, ‘cucumber’?” [normal accent] She was wearing a dress. They said, “Where’s your dress…?” [Spanish accent] “I don’t know if you have it, It’s from Zara.” [normal accent] They have a von Traap-amount of children, and, uh…\\n[audience laughing]\\nAnd they named them all, I’m not sure, but, very Spanish names like Jamón, and Croqueta, and Flamenco. You know? And all of this would be fine and beautiful, except… [Spanish accent] …that Hilaria from Espania… [normal accent] …is actually Hillary from Boston.\\n[audience laughing]\\nThis woman is in no way Spanish. Her parents are not from Spain. No one in her life is from Spain. You went, “What?” Did you think I was just doing a really racist Spanish impression…? You’re like, “Wow. Wow.” So, I’m not trying to bully a sociopath. I have a point. Okay?\\n[audience laughing]\\nSo I think what had happened was… I think she went to Spain. Because, again, I cannot tell you how much her family is not from Spain. They were early settlers in the U.S. I’m not fucking with you, they were on the Mayflower. That’s how much this chick is from Boston. But… I think what had happened was, she went to Spain. And I’ve been lucky enough to go to Spain. Some of you have. It’s great, right? Don’t you love it? I loved it, too. But Hillary from Boston fucking loved it. [Spanish accent] “I am going to be from it!” [normal accent] Did you know you can just decide where you’re from? Like, on my driver’s license, it says that I am from Splash Mountain.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIsn’t that great? Libby, do you ever go on vacation and have a good time?\\nWhere? Where’d you go?\\n[Libby] Mexico.\\nMexico? You’re from there. Enjoy. Enjoy. So here’s my point, okay. I actually have a point. Okay. My point is… that all evidence points to this woman, since she met her h',\n",
       "  'usband, has straight-up pretended to be from Spain. And her husband shot someone. Now, stay with me!\\n[audience laughing]\\nStay with me. My point is… neither of them give a fuck. Find someone who can stand you.\\n[audience cheering]\\nMy husband. The love of my life. We have sex sometimes. And, uh, married people, have you found this? We’ve found the best weekday to have sex is always tomorrow.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIs that when you guys have sex? “We ate today. Maybe we won’t… eat tomorrow. That’ll be a big day for us. You know?” “Yeah, we’ll definitely fuck each other tomorrow.” And then you do it. And you act like you went on some excursion. Like you were bowling. “That was fun. We have to remember we like doing that.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“We should bowl more. Why don’t we bowl?” If it were up to me, I’d bowl once a week. You too, yeah? Tomorrow. Tomorrow. My husband’s amazing. He always turns the lights on right before we have sex. You know? I shut ’em off, and he puts ’em on. Finally, he’s like, “Why are you so shy? I love your body. All your scars.” “You’re beautiful.” You know? And I was like, “Oh.” “You’re so cute. You think I don’t want you to see me.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Baby, my laser is about to kick in.” My husband actually just said these words to me before we had sex. He said, “Do you need me to go down on you?” “Do I need you to?” I’m like, “No, I just saw Top Gun. Thanks.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s hard to have sex with your spouse. I’ll say it. Because that’s your family. It’s like, we just had Thanksgiving together. I’m not gonna suck your dick. You’re my emergency contact for Christ’s sake!\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat’s disgusting. Can’t talk dirty to each other anymore. We know each other too well. You know, I’m like, “I’m gonna…” He’s like, “No, you’re not.” “No, I’m not.” “I want you to come all over…” “No, you don’t. No.” “No, I don’t.” We do a lot of roleplay. But I always pick the same role. You know, I’m always like, “Okay. I… am in a coma.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“Go.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI love him so much. I do. My husband is on the autism spectrum. And… Thank you. Thank you. It used to be called Asperger’s, but then they found out that Dr. Asperger had Nazi ties. Hate when that happens, right? Like some of our neighbors lately. Okay? Can we please love Jews? There aren’t that many of us left. Okay?\\n[audience cheering]\\nSo, yeah, he’s on the autism spectrum. And, uh… It’s called Autism Spectrum Disorder. And getting diagnosed has been so helpful to our family and to him, in helping us communicate. Making his life better, our life better, and he’s so fucking cool and brave that he’s down to be open about it, when there’s such a stigma, when it’s so stupid. because he’s my favorite person in the whole fucking world, other than my son, of course.\\n[audience cheering]\\nPeople don’t know much about autism. They hear and go, “Oh, does he love to count?”\\n[audience laughing]\\n\\n\\n\\n“Should we drop a bunch of straws on the floor and… he can gather them and count them?” I’m like, “Yeah, fuck it. Do it. Might be fun. I don’t know.” “I’d like to check that out, personally.” Being diagnosed, getting tested, just… it’s helped us so much. Like, I understand his behavior now. You know? Like, when someone’s in the middle of a long, boring story, he will straight up just walk away.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI’m like, “Where’s thi',\n",
       "  's motherfucker going?” Never really lands a compliment with me. He tells me I look comfortable a lot. We just have different love languages. You know? Like, I was feeling kind of sentimental the other night. We were sitting outside. It was… a nice night. It looked like it was gonna rain, and, uh… I just said, “You know, baby, even though these last couple of years, raising a toddler during a pandemic, it’s been so stressful. But still, getting to be with you, with our son, these have by far been the best years of my life.” And he just looked at me and he said, “I’m gonna go put the windows up in the car.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nThat’s my guy, you know? Yeah. That’s when we play the game, “Autism, or Just a Man?” I don’t know.\\n[audience laughing]\\nRight? This has been such a special, special show, special night. I’m gonna leave you with what he said to me right before I came out on stage tonight. I said, “Babe… is this okay?” He said, “Well, it’s too late.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nThank you so much, LA! I love you! I can stand you!\\n[audience cheering]\\n[upbeat music playing]\\nIt’s so easy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nAmy Schumer, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Hey, excuse me. Can I get a ride?\\nNo.\\nOkay. Fair enough. Chicago. Well, I have a meeting, and I don’t know you.\\nIt’s fine. I get that.\\nWhy should I even… You know, that’s an odd question to ask. You’re right. Now that I think about it… In the city here, with all the crime and everything, – just hop in and get a ride?\\nYou’re right. Best city in the world, baby… Chicago. Boom, a local spot… Willis Tower, on the corner, of course, of Jackson and Wacker. Now, Jackson and Wacker is famous ’cause of Andrew Jackson and because people used to get whacked. Right below me, the Chicago Pond, a beautiful piece of water. People swim in here. Olympics train in this thing. Jordan actually was inside the mold when they molded him. They cracked it, pulled him out, reassembled it. Boom. Here we are at The Wiener’s Circle, bro… The best hot dog in Chicago. And they treat me like I’m from here. Come on in. Hey, let me get a hot dog, ladies.\\nHow do you want it?\\nYou know how I want it, man. What, up your ass or down your fucking throat? Come on, order correctly, pussy lips. Let’s get it together. Before I continue this tour, I’m gonna get a drink. Ah, double fisting. Chi Town is a drinking city. Everybody knows that. Ah, beers for the crew, beers for the crew, beers for the crew. Cheers, you guys. Cheers. Okay, we had more planned. We’re never gonna get to it. You want to know more about Chicago, Google it, okay? Enjoy the special. Cheers. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to my grandson… Andrew Santino. We did it. We did it. Yes. Chicago, Illinois, my hometown, how are you? Yes. Crazy. That’s my grandmother, man. Yeah, that’s the best thing in the world. My grandmother brought me up. Give it up for Mary Garrity, man. Cheers. Cheers to you guys. Cheers. My grandfather, who passed away, used to say… A waitress would bring him water, and he would say, ‘What is that?’ And she’d say, ‘It’s water.’ And he said, ‘I’m thirsty, not dirty, so get me a drink.’ So cheers to my grandpa. Here we are, Chi Town. We did it. We came a long way. We’re here. I’m so happy to be back in this city. I’m back home. It’s amazing. I’m feeling the vibe again. You know what I mean? I took a walk around the lake. I was listening to conversations, two guys arguing, yelling at each other with that thick Chicago accent. You know, that… Ah, Chicago. It’s Chicago. ‘A’ s are ahs. Chi-cah-go. And Ts are Ds. Over dere in Chi-cah-go. You know that? ‘A’s, ahs, T, Ds, everyone’s racist. It’s such a good city. What a city. I heard two men fighting. Two men were in an argument, in just a verbal argument, not anything bigger than that, just arguing, and the one guy goes, ‘You know what? Why don’t you suck my dick?’ And the other guy goes, ‘Pfft! You suck my dick.’ And I was like, ‘Hey, suck each other’s dicks, man.’ That would’ve been a fight to see, huh? Comes up like, ‘You motherfucker.’ Finish him. Finish him.\\nWe got to stop saying it like that. Guys have to stop saying it like that ’cause girls are gonna start believing it. It has a negative connotation when you say that. You go, ‘Suck my dick.’ We say it negative. Suck my dick. You say it like it’s a bad thing. It’s the best thing in the world. It’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. We should say it nice. You should go, ‘Hey! ‘Suck my dick, please, if you have time. ‘If you don’t, it’s not a big deal. I would love it a lot.’\\nI’m proud of being from this town. I love this town. I miss it a lot. It’s where my family is from. My family’s still here. It’s great to come home, see my parents. They’re getting older, which is weird. That’s a hard thing, to see your parents get older… Like, honest older, You know when your parents just say shit that when you were a kid, you were like, ‘Oh, you never used to say shit like that when I was a kid.’ Like, my mom was like, ‘Well, I’m gonna leave the house. What are you gonna do for the weekend?’ And my dad was watching TV, and he turns, and he goes, ‘Eat steak, watch porn.’ I applaud the honesty out of that guy, really sharp. I appreciate that. Tell her the truth, man. They’re getting older. You know what I mean? They get older, but I love that about these people. They’re fantastic. They raised me. I mean, did they raise me correctly? I don’t know. Maybe not. I grew up here in downtown Chicago for half of my life in Chicago. In the second half, we moved to the western suburbs, right? We moved to the suburbs ’cause my sister was born, and my parents were like, ‘I’ m not gonna fuck up two of them. ‘We can’t do that. One’s good. We’ll fuck up one. That’s okay.’ We moved to the western suburbs, you know, to try to better the life of all of us, but, like, I still realize sometimes how, like, my mom used to fuck with us subtly. Like, my mom is crazy. She’s a crazy person in the best way, but she would, like, lay it in real slow. Like, my parents were somewhat re',\n",
       "  'ligious, right? You know, I mean, Irish Catholic kind of. You know what I mean? Like, somewhat in, you know what I mean? They’re, like, in the hot tub maybe. But she used to do this thing. She used to make me say, every single night before I went to bed, ‘Now I lay me down to sleep.’ Do you know that? Does anybody know that? I used to have to say this. I used to have to repeat this. I ‘d say,’ Now I lay me down to sleep. ‘I pray the Lord my soul to keep, ‘and if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.’ I would say that before bed, which is a really fucked-up thing… for a child to say out loud. If I die before I wake up? I’m six. I’m gonna die in the middle of the night, and God’s gonna leave my body, take my soul, but be like, ‘Body’ s good. Leave the body. It’s fine. Leave it.’ What’s going on?\\nCrazy person. I love her. She’s the best in the world. I had Irish Catholic guilt. I had so much Irish Catholic guilt when I was a kid, I used to flip a coin to determine whether or not I was gonna masturbate that day. You think I’m kidding? I would take a quarter. I would go, ‘Heads, yes, tails, no.’ I’d flip it, I’d get tails, and I’d go, ‘Ah, best two out of three. We got to go again. Let ‘s see what happens.’ He didn’t beat me, never won. That’s how heavy my guilt was. Seriously, that’s how, like, in my head I was about that God-is-watching-you type of stuff. Like, my mother used to let us not lock the doors. She was against it. She was like, ‘You don’ t lock the doors inside of the house. ‘If you’ re locking the doors inside of the house, it means you’re doing something you shouldn’t be doing.’ Yeah, that’s why we lock the doors. Don’t come in here. I’m pulling on my body. Get out of here. Leave me alone, lady. That’s how I realized the guy that invented locks inside of a house must’ve been caught masturbating by his wife one too many times. He was sick of it. He was sick of it. He’s like, ‘You know what? That’s it. I’m gonna put locks inside the house.’ She ‘s like,’ Michael, what are you doing? ‘We have locks on the outside of the house ‘to keep criminals from coming inside. There’s no criminals inside of this house.’ Yes, there are, Karen, and they’re robbing me of my freedom. Let me pull on my body in peace. Leave me alone, Karen.\\nAnyway, I love being from this city, and now I live in Los Angeles, California. I live on the other side of this great country. I like it out there. It’s okay. It’s a second home for me. It takes some getting used to. It’s a little bit difficult, but the big difference is, like, when I come back home, you know, like, all my mom wants to do is talk about, like, the weather. Like, that’s a big thing. My mom is like, ‘How is the weather in California? Is it nice like this?’ It’s like, ‘Yeah, it’s better than this. That’s why I’m out there. What are you talking about?’ It’s always better. It’s always better. It is. There’s a lot of stuff that isn’t better, but the weather’s always gonna be better, and she loves bringing up the ‘feels like’ meter. You know what that is? The news guy. The news guy’s like, ‘It’s 62. Feels like 68.’ That’s Midwest hope. That’s hope circulating in your body. It’s the greatest lie ever told. Who’s the ‘feels like’ guy? I want that job. If that’s a job, I want it tonight. I’ll drop this bullshit gig and go do that tonight. The ‘feels like’ guy… Greatest gig ever. Here in the studio, it’s 62 on the barometer. We’re gonna go live to Andrew Santino. Andrew, what does it feel like? How’s it going, news team? Like 67. Right back to you guys. Back to you guys, man.\\nIt’s nice, really nice out. It’s crazy, man, ’cause the weather here fluctuates so much. Like, when I come back, you’re never surprised. Like, you’re never surprised by anything in Chicago, but, like, who I feel bad for when I come back is the homeless people. I always feel bad for homeless here, man. Like, I don’t feel bad for homeless people in L.A. People can get mad at me for saying that. I don’t give a shit. They’re awful human beings, these L.A. homeless people. They’re terrible. They’re terrible people.\\nI feel bad for Chicago homeless, right? Because they die in the winter, and they die in the summer. They’re never not dying. They’re always dying. There’s, like, a week when it’s like, ‘We might make it,’ and that’s it, and they bucket-drum their way through that week. Soldiers, man. So I feel bad for homeless people in Chicago, from my heart, ’cause this is my home. So, when I come home, I give money. I gave money today to a homeless guy. I’m not lying. I gave money to a homeless guy ’cause I feel bad for him. I know what he’s got to go through. I gave that money to that guy, right? And I’ll always do that, but I also want to look him in the eye and go, ‘Hey, start walking south. You have nothing to do tomorrow. What are you doing here? You have something on your calendar? You don ‘t have a calendar.’ You can air-fistfight dragons all over this great country. I’m sure there’s half-smoked cigarettes strewn across this great land. I mean, the wind is their therapist. That’s all over the place. They can move about, man. You know the birds? You know those things? You know those guys? When they leave, follow those guys. Birds are born instinctively knowing, when it gets cold, to be like, ‘Oh, let’ s get the fuck out of here. ‘It’ s cold. Let’s leave. This is ridiculous. Why are we here? This is ridiculous.’ But I don’t feel bad for homeless people in Los Angeles at all… I really don’t. I don’t. I don’t feel bad for them. Some people are like, ‘Oh, that’s kind of mean.’ I don’t give a shit. I don’t give a shit, ’cause I live amongst these people, and they’re rude. They’re rude. You know why they’re rude? ‘Cause they made it. They’re at the promised land. It’s 72 degrees outside. You know what it is inside my place? Seventy-two. Who pays for that? I do. Fuck those guys. They won the lottery. They sleep on the beach.\\nI came out of a restaurant, right? I came out of a restaurant. When I first moved there, I had no money. I had zero money. Came out of a restaurant, had some leftovers, went up to a homeless',\n",
       "  ' guy, said, ‘Hey, sir, I got some leftovers. Would you like this?’ Okay? I’m on a date, in front of a lady. Would you like this, sir? And the homeless guy looks up at me, and he says, ‘What’s in it?’ And I looked at him, and I said, ‘Tomorrow.’ Another day on this earth. What are you, gluten-free? Eat the food. You’re cock-blocking me, man. I’m trying to smash a five. Help me out. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Times are tough. Who are you?\\nBut I like it. It’s my second home. This is my first home. L.A.’s my second home, and I do like it. There is things about it that I like. I live now in Los Angeles in a neighborhood called West Hollywood. West Hollywood is a gay neighborhood. It’s kind of like up here. It’s like where we are right now, Boystown. I like the gay neighborhood. The gay neighborhood is the best neighborhood. I’ve ever lived in in my life. It’s safe. It’s beautiful. I love it. I love it. You get in where you fit in, and I fit into that neighborhood, okay? I’m not gay, Dad, but… I’m down to live around gay people. They keep it clean and safe. I’ve never been attacked once in my neighborhood, and by the way, if I did get attacked, I would love to be attacked. What a beautiful way to walk home. A guy leaps out of a bush. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where? Where? Gives me outfit tips. They can fly, you know. I have a lot of gay friends because of that.\\nThey’re people just like you and me. There’s nothing different. There’s nothing different about that neighborhood. It’s cleaner and safer, and I fucking love it. The only difference is, I got a big beard. I’ve had big beard. I got to keep a big beard for a while. And that’s okay. Gay guys love guys with beards. Why? I don’t know. It’s a thing. It’s an underbelly thing. It’s on the Internet. Look it up. And I often get hit on. I get hit on a lot, okay? I get hit on way more in the gay community than in the straight community, and I’m okay with that. It’s a confidence booster, fellas. It feels nice. But I’ve lived in a gay neighborhood for so long that now I’m picky about what gay guy hits on me. A gay guy hollers at me, and I’m like, ‘All right, you couldn’t handle it, dude. ‘You couldn’ t handle it. Too tight, too tight. ‘Keep walking, man. Pinch it right off. Get up out of here, man.’ Couldn’t have it.\\nThat’s some true shit. You got to be careful of social cues. Social cues mean a lot, right? And guys are stupid. Men are stupid. We’re stupid people by nature. We’re just dumb. We don’t give a shit, by the way, when girls are like, ‘Men are dumb.’ I don’t care. You think I care you think I’m dumb? I don’t give a shit. I know I’m dumb. It feels really good. Try going out your day without talking about a relationship. That’s what you guys do all day. It’s like, ‘I heard he was with her, but then she was’… And we just walk around like… It’s great. It’s fantastic. I don’t worry about shit. It makes my day so much easier, but guys are idiots, and I’m proud to be an idiot. But social cues amongst men are interesting because you got to be careful what you do in my neighborhood, right? Like, in my neighborhood, it’s a little bit different, ’cause when I walk down the street and I see another guy, right, I do this thing. If I see you, and I walk down the street, right, we pass each other, and I go like this, what do you do? If I go like… Yeah, you dude me right back, right. You dude me right back. He dudes me. We dude it. Hey, dude it. We dude it. Do we know why we dude? No. Zero clue. We walk around like pigeons all day like, ‘Hey, hey.’ We don’t give a shit. I do it to black guys to show them that I’m not a pussy. I go, ‘Hey, what’ s up? We good, we good? ‘We’re good. I’m good with the black guy. ‘In case a fight breaks out, we got a black guy. ‘We’ re good. We got one. We’re good, we’re good. We got him.’ I have no idea why we do that. We share genitalia. There’s no other reason that we do that to one another. But you can’t do that in my neighborhood ’cause it means something totally different… and it hurts. It hurts a lot.\\nI like living there. I do like it. I really do. Like, I like living in Los Angeles. I like progressive culture, okay? I really do. I like the way that people think about other people as humans instead of a subset, right? This country got all up in arms. Everybody voted to make bathrooms gender-neutral. I don’t know if you know about that, but there was a big debate going on around this country about should we make bathrooms gender… Should we be able to let other people use bathrooms that didn’t initially have that genitalia, right? People that are transsexual. Should we let them use our bathrooms? Ooh, careful. Who knows what could happen? What could happen? Nothing. They’re gonna shit in your bathroom that you shit in. You think your bathroom’s that important, where you let go of all your fluids. You care that much about your fluids that you care who comes after. When I go in there, I ‘m like,’ Aah! ‘There better be someone else decent that comes in after me. ‘I don’ t want some transsexual coming in after that. Who knows what they ‘ll do?’ Who do you think you are?\\nIt was a big debate, gender-neutral bathrooms. And I’m all for it. Bathrooms are bathrooms. I don’t give a shit who uses my bathroom after me. Use it. You got to go, go ahead. Use the bathroom, man. It’s a good thing. For years, I was sick and tired of going to a bar and seeing girls cut the bathroom line when theirs are too long. They walk to the guys, and they go, ‘Hi, our line’ s too long. ‘Do you think me… Can we cut? Is this chill if we cut?’ I know that’s a stereotypical impression. I don’t give a shit. That’s real. ‘Can we cut?’ That’s real. And every asshole in line is like, ‘Yeah, go ahead.’ Also real, also real, also a real impression of us. You go like that. We go like that. Okay? So guys let them in, and I’m tired of that shit, ’cause we can’t use your bathrooms. Guys can’t use girls’ bathrooms at bars. You can use ours. Why can’t we use yours? The only thing I ever hear is, ‘Well, you pee on the seat.’ Do we? I don’t. I don’t pee on the seat. If yo',\n",
       "  'u live with someone that pees on the seat, it’s ’cause they hate your fucking guts. They’re sending you a message. Oh, no, you get the groceries, Karen, you fucking bitch. Fucking asshole. He’s saying something to you. That’s between you two. What do you think? You think we walk in the bathroom, we just open it up, and let it go, and it’s, like, wherever it goes, it goes. I know where it goes. I got a laser pointer. I know precisely where it goes. Pff, right there. Pee on the seat. That’s amazing. It’s ridiculous.\\nTo me, I think the fix has always been remove the stalls from men’s bathrooms in bars. Remove them. Urinals or just holes in the ground, it doesn’t really matter. Guys will pee into anything. We don’t really give a shit. But get the stalls out of men’s bathrooms in bars because they shouldn’t be there in the first place, okay? They should never have been there, ’cause a girl can’t walk in now and use a urinal. Unless you can, ladies, and then I want to see it. If you can tippy-toe pee, I would love to see it. I don’t know if it’s this way or that way. I don’t know which way is better, but if you can do that, I want to check it out. But there shouldn’t be stalls in men’s bathrooms in bars in the first place, because who the fuck is pooping at the bar? You’re gonna poop at the bar? You’re gonna poop here? Steve, you’re gonna poop at the bar. The bar that we’re at, you’re gonna poop at this bar? You feel okay with that as a person, pooping at the bar? Okay, now I know who you really are. Pooping at the… Who are your friends? Who’s your family? Go home, you animal. What are you, you pig person? Poop at the bar? Are you out of your mind? You’re gross. You’re a gross human. You don’t poop at the bar. You man up if you have to poop. You man up if you have to poop. You finish your drink, pinch it off, and you walk home, so you can poop at the house naked like a grown-up… like a full-grown adult. If you’re pooping at the bar that I’m at and I see you doing that, I’m gonna walk in, look under, walk out, and go, ‘Hey, there’ s a guy pooping here ‘wearing blue Adidas. Blue Adidas, yeah. He ‘s pooping right now.’ And then leave you with your mistake. Why is everybody looking at my shoes? ‘Cause you pooped here, Mike. What’s wrong with you? Get your life locked up, pig. Go home, you pig. Say that next time you see someone pooping in a bathroom. Walk in and go, ‘Go home, you pig. You make me sick.’\\nUnbelievable, man, how we prote… We protect the bathrooms like they’re a big deal. Who gives a shit about the bathrooms? Dude, go to the bathroom. We protect bathrooms in this country like it’s something important. It’s remarkable to me. Sometimes you go to a restaurant, and you’re like, ‘Hey, can I get the key to the bathroom? It’s locked.’ They’re like, ‘Oh, yeah, we got the key. Here you go.’ It’s attached to a comically large ladle for no reason. You got a spoon on the goddamn thing. Now you got to take that in there, find a place for it. It’s gonna be a nightmare. Go ahead. You’re gonna hate every second of that. Why do we do that? We lock them. You keep the bathroom under lock and key? You realize in every restaurant, every restaurant you can walk right in, go right into the kitchen? There’s no locks on a kitchen. Just walk in and go, ‘Hey, what’s up, you guys?’ Dunk your hand in some soup. More salt. Needs more salt. I got to go. I want to use the bathroom. You got the key? No. Get real.\\nIt’s a weird country, man. We live in a weird country. We live in a weird time. I didn’t want to talk about anything that’s going on right now, but because I got a lot of time, it’s the late show, I’ll do whatever the fuck I want. So let me say this. I’m proud to be from where I’m from, okay? I’m proud to be from Chicago, Illinois. I’m proud to be from the United States of America. I’m not trying to get on a patriotic kick. All I want to say is, we got some fucked-up things going on in our country. Times are really crazy. It’s unfortunate as fuck. It’s awful. People on both sides are blaming people on both sides, okay? I have cops that are in my family. Every cop is not a bad fucking person, and every person isn’t a bad person, right? These are the same fucking things. So don’t point fingers at either side. We need to be better people in general, across the fucking board. That’s it. That’s it. Good.\\nI’m a… I’m a guy who recently, thankfully, found a woman who was dumb enough to stick around. Stupid girl, stupid girl. ‘Cause look at this, you know. Like, look at guys. You’re gross. Why would they even go for us? Why would a woman want to do stuff with you? You’re gross. You’re disgusting. Look at a naked woman. Take one look at a naked woman, right? Beautiful, symmetrical, hairless. What a creature. Whatever made it finely crafted it like a Ferrari, you know? Took time with it. And then they got to the guy, and they were like, ‘Ah, we ran out of time. ‘No, put the genitals on the outside. ‘It doesn’ t matter. ‘No one’ s gonna see. Who cares? ‘Hair? Throw some hair on it. Fine, throw some hair on it.’ It’s phenomenal. Every day we’ve fooled you. Like, we should wake up, guys, and just be like, ‘Ah, tricked them. ‘We tricked them again. We got away with murder.’ I don’t know how we ever convinced you to do anything in the first place. Kiss me where I pee? Kiss me where I pee? How? How? How? You know that place that you breathe and eat from? May I stuff my dick in there? Can I clog up your source of life with some flesh? Life, the life hole, can I just… Cork it? I want to cork it. I want to cork your life hole with my body. How on earth did you say yes? Cork it?\\nIt’s a remarkable thing, when you think about it. Like, how did we ever even start the sexual chemistry to even get to that level of doing stuff? Here you go. A guy can go to a bar. A single guy goes to a bar trying to pick up chicks. He can go out there and mumble around. I want to put my body in your body. That’s all he’s saying. Baseline level, I want to put my body in your body. Can we do that? You sound debonair at the bar. You ‘re like,’ Well, well, I work for an investment firm do',\n",
       "  'wntown.’ But what you’re really saying is, like, ‘I want to put my body in your body. I’d like to put my body inside of your body.’ That’s all it is. You’re not that cool. You’re just trying to put some of your body in someone’s body. You got a gap. I got a wedge. Can we do the thing when I put the thing in the thing? That’s it. Think about that… That’s a hard thing to do, to go out to a bar and convince a girl I’m the guy that you want to do things with.\\nThink about how hard it was for us to start that. How did we start that? How did a caveman ever get to that point with a cave woman? How did a caveman say that when there was no language, no communication skills? First of all, when you were a caveman, you just stood around with your buddies, mumbling. That’s it. There’s really nothing going on, just a lot of… Then one of you, out of nowhere, would just get an erection. Explain that to the crew. All your buddies are mad. Hey! They don’t like it pointing at them. You got to be a nonverbal dick salesman, going up to women like… What are you selling? She doesn’t know. You can’t say it. Who said yes? The slowest girl in the pack… on a bad leg she was lugging around. Okay, okay. Okay. How did that happen? The guy that convinced a girl to do that for the first time invented fire and the wheel that afternoon.\\nIt was like…\\nEverything clicked. I got it. Everything made sense. I would’ve loved to see the first caveman to discover pulling out. That would’ve been amazing. Right? The first guy that’s like… That’s how all that shit on the wall got started. They were like… What, do you think that was ink? That was no ink. It’s jizz symbols. How great is that fucking thing? My buddy’s an artist, and I was like, ‘I want a fucking papa bear ‘with a cubby bear with a Blackhawks headdress, ‘and I want him wearing Jordans for the Bulls ‘and white socks, and I want him eating deep dish and drinking a beer.’ And my buddy smoked enough pot as I did, and he came up with this. So it was fucking pretty amazing.\\nThe Chicago flag, yeah. Cool. It’s cool. We got a lot of pride in this town, so we should. You know what I mean? You can’t fuck with us. Come fuck with us. Where’s my crane camera? Come fuck with us, rest of the United States. Where the fuck are you guys at? Come to Chicago. Rip your fucking throats out. I’m gonna get murdered on the road in Cincinnati in, like, three months. Shit. No, I got a lady. I got a lady this year. I got locked up. I got married this year, which was great. It was a great thing. Don’t clap for that. Please don’t clap for that shit ’cause it eggs her on, and I don’t need that.\\nNo, I got married, and it was great. It was very fun. We had a good time. Yeah, it was fun. Thanks a lot. Cool. It was cool, it was cool. She came up to me at the jump, and she was like, she ‘s like,’ What do you think about doing, like, bachelor, bachelorette parties, like, all that stuff?’ We didn’t talk about, like, really any of that stuff. We really kind of didn’t really get into the nitty-gritty, and I was like, ‘Well, whatever you want to do.’ She was like, ‘Do you want to have a bachelor party?’ And I was like, ‘I don’ t know. ‘Like, I do stand-up for a living, ‘so, like, it’ s just always kind of a fucking bachelor party. My life is kind of a bachelor party.’ I was like, ‘No, I’m good.’ You know what I mean? Like, I just took my best friend for his bachelor party, and I was like, ‘That’s good enough for me.’ I was like, ‘You can do a bachelorette party. Don ‘t feel like you can’t.’ She was like, ‘Are you cool with it?’ I was like, ‘I promise. I’m totally cool with it. Whatever you want to do, you ‘re good. Do it.’ She was like, ‘Okay, trust me. It ‘ll be classy.’ That’s some dumb shit. Girls are like, ‘It’ s gonna be classy. ‘The bachelorette party… It’s gonna be cla… I promise. We won’t be as crazy as you think we’re gonna be.’ She was like, ‘We’ re going to Northern California ‘to a vineyard. We ‘re gonna do wine tasting.’ So in girls’ brains, they think that we think that that’s nice and sweet, but I know the truth. I know they’re not wine tasting. I know they’re blacking out on wine. I know they’re getting purple toothed out, Charlie Chaplain-ing around town like… I know. I know what you’re doing, looking like Grimace. I know. I know. Lie to me, you drunks… trying to pretend like… We pretend like wine is so sophisticated. It’s still booze. Stinky-foot grapes, that’s all it is. Go on a vineyard tour with her girlfriends.\\nSee, ’cause here’s the thing about bachelorette parties. I’m sure every girl in this room is a wonderful human being. I’m sure you’re all stand-up citizens until you get in a bachelorette party, and then you’re a piece of shit. Then you’re a piece of shit. Then you storm around town like, ‘Look at us, penises everywhere. ‘Penises on our body. ‘Penis necklace. These are dick-laces. ‘These are dick necklaces. This is a dick hat. ‘These are dick glasses. They’re dick shoes. ‘Look at it. It comes. This one comes. ‘It comes out of that shoe. When I go like that, it comes.’ What’s wrong with you? Who are your parents? Shame on you, these women who walk around town doing that shit. It’s unbelievable… Bachelorette parties that take over every bar they go to, screaming. These bitches work in HR during the day, but at night… they’re just like, ‘Penis, penis, penis. Penis, penis, penis, penis.’ Who are your parents? Shame on you. You realize some little kid in China has to make those penis molds? Some little kid in China is pressing penises, penis sunglasses, so you can go out like, ‘Cocks, cocks on my head.’ You psycho.\\nThat’s where guys beat you. That’s, like, the one spot we beat you. We may be dumber than you, but we beat you there. We beat you by a landslide, because I have never been to a bachelor party where they’re like, ‘Santino, you ready to go? Put on your pussy costume. Let ‘s go.’ I put one on like… ‘Come on, let’ s go. ‘Get mine wet. Steve, get mine wet. ‘Get it wet. Get the clit wet. ‘Go. Get it wet. This is what we want.’ ‘Vaginer.’ We beat you. So we went and got married out of the country. We went to Costa Ric',\n",
       "  'a. We went down to Costa Rica. It was great. Central America, beautiful place. Costa Rica is amazing. We loved it. It was fantastic. I didn’t know that racism is everywhere. I had no idea, but it is, but it really fucking is. Here we are in our hotel, two men are in a fight with one man, two guys on one, two on one, working this dude, and I look out the window, and I’m like, ‘Oh, my God, what happened?’ To the local guy. And the local guy, who we know, who we’re buddies with, is like, ‘Oh, yeah, the fight?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, what happened?’ I’m ready for the story. And he ‘s like,’ Okay, you see this guy on the ground? ‘You see him on the ground, ‘this guy who they kick in the face? ‘You see him? ‘You know, this guy on the ground they kick in the teeth. You see him?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, what is that?’ And he goes, ‘Oh, yeah, this guy, this guy on the ground, he ‘s from Panama.’ What? ‘He’ s from Panama. Panama, the country. Panama.’ That’s it? That was as deep as the well got dug. ‘He’s from Panama.’ That’s it. I was like, ‘But how did the fight… Like, how did you… How did the fight happen?’ He goes, ‘Oh, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí. ‘Okay, so this guy on the ground, ‘he cut off this guy in traffic, ‘and he says to him, ‘Hey, what the fuck?’ ‘And this guy, he says, ‘Hey, man, fuck you.’ ‘So this guy, he gets out of his car, ‘and he says, ‘Mm-mm, fuck you.’ ‘So then they yell at each other. ‘So this guy say fuck you. ‘This guy, fuck you. This guy, fuck… So both of these guys are fucking you right now.’ I was like, ‘No one’ s fucking me. What are you talking about?’ ‘And then his friend, he hear him from across the street, ‘and his friend, he says, ‘Hey, what happened?’ ‘He says, ‘He said, fuck you.’ ‘He says,’ Ah, fuck you.’ ‘He says, ‘Fuck you.’ He says. ‘Fuck you.’ He fuck… these guys over here are fucking you.’ ‘And the one guy, he says to him… ‘Before he fight with him, he says, ”Hey, motherfucker, where are you from?’ ‘And this guy, he says, ‘Panama.’ ‘And, uh… That ‘s it for him.’ Other than that, it was a beautiful country, man. It was gorgeous, man. We did so much white-people shit. It was unbelievable. You know what white-people shit is. Everybody in here knows it, right? It’s, like… We went zip-lining. It’s, like, white-water rafting, all that white-people… White-water rafting is white-people shit. It’s called white-water rafting. It’s ours. That’s some white-people shit. You’ll never, ever see a black guy white-water rafting, skydiving, drinking coffee. That’s just not what they do. It’s not what they do. Skydiving, all that shit. Black guy, do you go skydiving? Never in your fucking life, man. No way. Never in your life. Rock climbing?\\nNo way.\\nWhite-water rafting?\\nNo.\\nNone of the above. Do you even like coffee?\\nI do like coffee.\\nOh, come on, man. What did he say?\\nI like it black.\\nYou like it black. I get that. I get that. You can have that. Take it black. Take it black. So he knows what I’m talking about. He knows. I went to college with… One of my closest friends in college was this dude we lived with, and he would always make fun of me. He ‘s like,’ You’re doing some white-people shit, Red. You on some white-people shit right now.’ I was like, ‘I’m taking out the trash.’ He’s like… ‘That’s the type of shit I’m talking about, motherfucker. ‘Just throw that shit outside, bitch. ‘White-people shit! ‘What you doing, dishes, motherfucker? You white-ass motherfucker.’ What you doing, laundry, you Charmin-ass motherfucker? You Charmin’…\\nI did so much white-people shit in Costa Rica. It was bananas. I loved it, though. I love being a tourist. Like, that’s the fucked-up thing about Americans. We don’t want to be tourists. Why not? Why are we so afraid of being tourists? I’ll do that zip-line dork-ass shit. Give me the helmet. I love that. How much is the picture? $1,000? I don’t give a shit. I’ll pay for that, plan for it. Come on, man. Give me that dork tourist shit. We’re so afraid as Americans to be tourists. Yet for some reason, tourists come here. They’re not afraid to be tourists. You can go to Michigan Avenue right now. There’s a cute little Italian couple that’s like, ‘Mi scusi, mi scusi, mi scusi. The water tower, the water tower.’ And you ‘re like,’ Ah, come here. Let me lie to you. Come here, come here, come here.’ Let them be tourists, man. Be a tourist. Be a tourist. All I’m saying is, stop being such a liar. Be who you really are. You’re out of the country. Be out of the country, man. There’s nothing wrong with that, you know. Here’s why. Every time I’ve ever been to a Spanish-speaking country, there’s always one guy in the crew, one dude who’s like, ‘Hey, I got us. I can take us around. ‘I speak a little bit of Mexican. ‘We’ re gonna be good. We ‘ll be good.’ You speak Mexican, Brad? I speak Mexican, dog. I got us. Don’t sweat it, man. I took 101 in high school. We’re gonna be straight. And you’re like, ‘All right, man. I can’t wait.’ You walk into a restaurant. I say the truth. I walk in, I go, ‘Hello, American, americano, ‘American, ready to be ripped off. Look at me.’ ‘Cause I don’t give a shit. How much is that Coke? Seven? Thought it was ten. You can’t fuck me. You can’t fuck me. I planned for that. You cannot fuck me. But he walks in. Brad walks in, talking Mexican like, ‘Hola, seniors. Hola, seniors.’ He thinks he’s the shit. Brad walks in heavy, and the staff looks at him like, ‘Okay, okay, okay, okay. ¿Habla español, señor? ¿Habla español? ¿Habla español?’ Sí, sí, sen-yours. Sí, sí, sen-yours. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. And they ‘re all like,’ Okay. ‘Hmm. Good, good, good. That’s good, good. That’s good.’ And they just machine-gun Spanish at his fucking head until you see him go, ‘Oh, fuck. ‘There’s no bibliotecain there. Where’s the ban-yo? I don’t know any of those words.’ Brad looks like an asshole. Meanwhile, I’m enjoying my plate of rice and ‘polo,’ having a great time… enjoying my life.\\nI came back from Costa Rica. It was fantastic, and then we got into that, like, all the marriage discussion shit. She was like, ‘What do you want to do',\n",
       "  ' about the last name?’ I was like, ‘I don’ t know. I mean, I don’t really care. I don’t think I really care.’ I was like, ‘I mean, what do you want to do?’ She’s like, ‘Well, do you want me to take your last name?’ And there’s a part of you that’s like, ‘No, man, it’s cool.’ Then there’s a part of you that’s like, ‘Yeah, you got to take the last name.’ It’s some male-ego bullshit, but that’s the truth of the situation. Like, it doesn’t really mean much. Like, what are last names anyway? I don’t really know. We don’t really know, you know. Last names… you used to give to somebody ’cause it represented land, right? You had some land. You get some land to give. Like, ‘This will all be yours one day.’ That doesn’t mean shit nowadays. I can’t be like, ‘Son, this condominium will be yours when I die.’ Who gives a shit, right? There’s not much to it. You know, it really doesn’t mean much.\\nBut it’s strange when I think about, like, white people’s last names, like, where our last names came from. A lot of times, it used to be your occupation, right? Like, I meet a guy… Kevin Blacksmith. His great-great-great-great- grandfather was a blacksmith. Dave Shoemaker, his great-great-great-great- grandfather was a shoemaker. But it’s weird when you meet a white guy named Eric Lynch… ‘Cause you’re like, ‘Your great-great-great-great- grandfather was a bad person.’ Switch it up, dog.\\nBut last names are kind of bullshit. You know know what I mean? They mean whatever they want and whatever you want them to mean, and so she said, ‘What do you want to do?’ I said, ‘How about we just go with whosever last name is cooler?’ Right, whosever’s is cooler. She was like, ‘Cooler?’ I was like, ‘Yeah,’ ’cause in my head, I knew it was already game over. I was like, ‘Jordan, buckets.’ I knew it was over. I knew it was over. She wasn’t fucking with Santino. What a cool-ass name, Santino. Three syllables… San, unh, ti, got you, oh. That’s what’s up. I had it. It was in the bag, man. It was in the bag. It was game over. Jordan. It was game over, but then she was like, ‘Oh, you think your last name is that much cooler?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ Her last name was Eichelberger. You want me to say it again? Eichelberger. And she’s like, ‘What’s wrong with that?’ I was like, ‘What’ s right with that shit? What are you talking about, lady?’ She’s like, ‘It’s not that big of a deal.’ I said, ‘Well, it’s like part of the Third Reich.’ I’ll have to walk into restaurants, like… ‘We’ re here for the Eichelberger party, ‘the party of two. ‘There is two of us at the party. ‘We would like the table in the back of the room. ‘In the back of the room, ‘behind the air-conditioning, please. Thank you.’ Anyway, she’s a Santino now. Yeah.\\nWe got into a thing, ’cause I was… I feel like I’m watching too much porn lately, if I’m just being real with you guys. We’re getting real. It’s a late-night show. I was watching too much porn. Porn is bad. It’s a bad thing. It’s really addictive. It is. It truly is. I think it’s not my fault, though. I think it’s access… access, too much access. In your pockets, there’s a phone, right? In there is all the porno… All of it… all of it that we make. All of it that we make, you guys. If I had three seconds inside of a time machine, I would ‘zorb’ myself to when I was 14, for three seconds, and just go… ‘In the future, all the porno’s in your pocket,’. And get out… and blow my mind. Just… semen everywhere. Oh, my God. I’m waiting for this JPEG to load. Come on, man. That’s crazy. That is crazy to think about. It really is too much access. Like, I can’t walk past a laptop without being like… ‘Ah, this is Best Buy. I got to go.’ The Blue Shirts, they don’t like that. You know what I mean? They get weird. We’ve seen so much of it. The problem is… With porn is, it’s got this stigma where we think we can emulate that stuff. Like, you think you’re like them. You’re not like them. Those are pros, man. Those are pros. I got envy. I have envy, envy. The way that these men throw a rope is remarkable. They just… It takes off. It’s got loft. Are you kidding me? I’m lucky if mine comes out. It’s like a pensive army. It gets to the surface, and it ‘s like,’ No, no. Go back, go back.’ And when it does come out, it’s late for the party. It has nonalcoholic beer. It’s like, ‘Sorry. We’re here.’ My wife… one night she was like, ‘Oh, come on my tits.’ I was like, ‘Oh, I’ll never make it up there.’ It’s so far. It’s too far. Maybe your belly button, max… if I really put in the work.\\nI’ll tell you what I’ve been watching a lot of. I’ve been watching a lot of black porn, lots of black porn. Blackblack. Too. Like, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Deep chocolate, 99% cacao chocolate. Sexy. No milk. Get out of here, milk chocolate. No time for you. Chocolate, chocolate. I love watching black porn, love watch… For one fundamental reason. The guys get to wear shoes… on their feet. Men wear shoes on their feet. If you know anything about how shoes and pants work, anything at all, you know that these men took off their shoes, took off their pants and underwear, and then put back on their shoes. Come on. You did it again, black people. Numero uno. I got the envy, man. It’s a bad thing. It really is. It’s a bad thing.\\nWe need to clean up our minds, clean up our life. You know what I mean? Get clean, clean living. Eat a smoothie, take a walk. It’s difficult, man. It’s difficult to do. People always… like, listen, I try to work out. I’m trying to be in shape. I’m trying to do all that stuff. It’s a hard thing to do. You know, fast food, going to get fast food always reminds me of what it was like when I was single, going to a one-night stand. It was like the same thing, like the exact same feeling. You’ll be looking on Google Maps to try to find out if that fast-food joint’s open, right? You’re like, ‘You up, McDonald’s? You up?’ You send a late-night text, like, ‘What’ s up, girl? ‘You up? What’s up, McDonald’s? ‘You up? What’s up, Mac D’s? Is you up, playboy? Give me them nuggets.’ She’s like, ‘Uh-huh.’ McDonald’s is like, ‘You know it.’ You cruise over there, and on the way,',\n",
       "  ' you’re like, ‘Ooh, it’ s gonna be good. ‘I know what I get at this location. ‘This is my favorite spot to go to at this time of night. That number two is my spot right now.’ That’s a butt joke. You get over there, and you eat that. You devour that McDiesel’s. Just like that, you’re like… Devour it. And when you’re done, you get in the car and cruise home… Same feeling. Cruising home, and you’re like… ‘I’m a bad person, man.’ Sad. I had to cut that out. I had to cut it out, man. I’m trying to stay healthy. I’m trying to fit into my own skin. That’s really what it is. You know, I’m trying to feel good about myself. It’s a confidence thing about people. You want to feel confident and cocky, but, like, not too much. Like, I had my ego tested. I got into a car accident. A man hit me. A man hit me. I was at a red light. A man hit me, okay? Red light, skrrr, man, bmm-bmm-bmm, hit me, and I got out of my car. He got out of his car, and I went to say something. Before I could say anything, he goes, ‘Hey, what the fuck?’\\nAnd I said…\\n‘That’ s my line. ‘I say that. That’s me. ‘I’m doing… That’s what I do. You say, ‘I’m sorry,’ I feel like.’ He was a big-ass dude. He was big, jacked up, and he had tattoos up to his face? Question mark. You good, bro? On your face? You cashed out? You got cancer? What’s up? On your face? I feel like that’s some, like, ‘I don’t give a… ‘Whatever, bro. Go ahead. It’s done. ‘I don’ t give a shit. ‘I’ ve been collecting Marlboro miles for years. I ‘ll cash out.’ On your face? So I had no way to win this war. This dude was in my face. I had no… I was backed up. I was like, ‘Whatever, man.’ And in that moment, I was like, ‘I can’ t win this argument with this dude. I can ‘t beat him physically.’ But I was like, ‘If I had a superpower right now, ‘you know, it wouldn’ t be to, like, fly or be invisible. I would love to be able to throw acne on somebody.’ Right? He’s all, ‘Fuck you.’ I’m like, ‘Fuck me? Fuck you, man.’ No! Hit him all over the body, shoulder, bacne. Hit him with the bacne. Hit him with the kn-acne, that knee acne. Light him up, light him up. Scar him physically and emotionally, send him home like that for a couple of weeks, depending on the topical cream. Let it sit. Let it sit. If you’re not laughing at that, you didn’t have acne when you were a kid. I had really bad acne when I was a kid, man. It was so bad. It was so bad. Like, acne is, like, the sole reason I questioned God. I’m like, ‘What up, dude? What’s the deal? ‘Where are you at on this one, player? This is ridiculous.’ Here you are, 13, 14 years old. You’re the ugliest version of yourself. Look at photos of you at 14. TBT them on Instagram, and you’re like, ‘Ooh, tough-looking kid.’ You’re ugly, bro. You are ugly at 14.\\nTeenagers are so gross to look at, hard to see. They’re hard to see, bro. They’re skinny. Their voices are crackling. They’re wobbling all over like little skinny baby giraffes, just hungry and horny like… Nasty-looking crea… They look like Tim Burton cartoons. They’re barely alive. You are nasty as a child. And you’re telling me at this vulnerable point in your life, God is gonna be like, ‘You know what? ‘I’ m gonna put some red pus bumps on his face. Pus bump his face up.’ I didn’t get it. I didn’t understand it. I had it so bad. I had to go on Accutane. You used to have to sign a form that said. ‘I can die from this medication.’ What’s up, guys? What are we saying? I can die from this medi… I can die from this medication. And I was underage, so I had a legal guardian. So my mother had to sign it. I was 16. I’ll never forget. They slipped the sheet to my mother, and she looked at it, and then she looked at me. Yeah. Yeah, this is… it’s… it’s better than your face. It doesn’t really matter. You’re an ugly kid. You’re ugly. It’s… it’s for you. I had it so bad. I had acne so bad when I was young. When I was in high school, I played basketball for a couple years at my high school until I found out about drugs, and I was like, ‘See you later, basketball.’ Ah, true story.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut I played basketball for a little while. When I played basketball, I made the JV team pretty early on, and we played in a summer league, okay? In the summer league, you had to play all the other schools that you were going to play in that regular season, and I’ll never forget. We went out to West Aurora to go play these guys, and they were supposed to beat us. They were, like, a really good school, right? They were really good. They were an all-black school. We were a some-black school. They were gonna beat us. Bottom line, they were gonna win. And we went out there, and we beat the shit out of these guys. I had the game of my life. I dropped four points. I was on fire. If you know anything about high-school basketball, four points is like, whoa. What are you, MVP? Final score, 12-2. It was a blowout. I mean, we went out there. I had a great game. I was on cloud nine. I felt like a king. Then I left, and I went out to the hallway to go get a drink of water. I’m getting a drink of water, bending down by the water fountain to have a drink of water. A little black kid, like, eight years old walks in the hallway. Comes up to me and goes, ‘Hey, yo, white boy. White boy.’ I go, ‘What’s up?’ You’re pretty good, man. Oh, thanks, man. He goes, ‘For a white boy.’ And I was still like, ‘Thank you. I appreciate that.’ I’ll take it. Then he goes, ‘All right, man.’ I go, ‘All right, man.’ He walks away. Felt good. Go down to get some more water. He gets to the doorway. He stops… real Forest Whitaker-style. He turns around and goes, ‘Hey, yo, white boy.’ I say, ‘What’s up, man? What up?’ He goes, ‘What the fuck is all over your face?’ That still hurts today. I’m in my 30s. That cut went all the way to the bone. You know what I mean? Then I walked up to him slowly, and I said, ‘Well, this is what happens when your dad sticks around.’ No, I didn’t say that. That’s a joke, man. No, I called him the N word. Then I got out of there as fast as I could. No, stop it. I cried on the bus, man. I cried on the bus. Got to have a sense of humor, man.\\nBut I always loved blac',\n",
       "  'k people. I always did. I really did. I still do. I still do love black people, man. I think they’re fantastic human beings. Black people always accepted me. Black people really did. White people never liked me. White people don’t like redheads for some reason. There’s this thing. White people see redheads, and they’re like, ‘What do we do with it?’ They don’t like us. They don’t trust us. They make a day to kick us. Call us names… ‘You fire crotch, you ginger.’ They ask us stupid questions, like does the carpet match the drapes? A black guy’s never said that to me. White guys… ‘The carpet match the drapes, bud?’ And I’m always like, ‘Are you a grown-up asking ‘about my penis hair? ‘Is that the level that you’re on? ‘You’ re worried about my penis hair, dude. ‘If you must know, it’s hardwood floors. There ‘s no carpet there, bro.’ I clean it up. Go get you a little buzzer from Target and clean that shit up. You get under there. It’s like… It’s working overtime under there. That’s the no-fly zone, no-fly zone. It might die under there, like… I can’t, I can’t. White people never liked me. They never did. They always made fun of me. That’s a reality check. Now people are like, ‘Huh? What are you talking about?’ White people always made fun of redheads. Redheads are this outcast. We’re this weird minority for some reason, but black people always liked me. They really did. They took to me. Like, black people like white people with a deficiency. I’m like a dog with one bad leg. You know, white people don’t adopt that dog, but black people are like, ‘No, no, no. ‘He good, he good, he good. ‘He gonna be fine. Come here, Tripod. ‘He gonna be fine. Tripod. ‘Come here, Tripod. It gonna work out.’ That’s just the truth. It just made me feel normal when I was a kid. So I loved hip-hop culture. I loved everything all my black friends liked, so much so that in the ’90s, people used to say this word. People used to call me a ‘wigger.’ Do you remember that word? Don’t get uncomfortable. You all said it. You all said it. I don’t know why we got rid of it. It was hilarious. You should’ve stuck around for a while. People used to call me a ‘wigger.’ People used to say ‘wigger’ to me ’cause they thought it would hurt my feelings. They thought, like, that was a way to get my goat. You know what I mean? And I’ll never forget. I was on a basketball court the first time I heard it, and we had won this basketball game, and this dude from the losing team says… ‘Whatever, bro. That dude ain’t nothing but a wigger.’ And all my black friends heard it, and they were disappointed. They heard him say that, and they were like… That’s how they sound, like a train. They were like… When black guys are bummed out, it sounds like a train, just… Next stop, Sedgwick. But they were bummed out ’cause that was an attack, you know. They didn’t like that, but when I heard it, I heard it different, ’cause they were like, ‘That white dude ain’t nothing but a wigger.’ And I heard it, and I was like, ‘Oh… so close.’ How do I get that N? How do I get that N? These are Karl Kani jeans. This is a Perry Ellis shirt. Give it to me. I bought Timberland boots. Say it if you’re gonna say it, you racist motherfuckers. Say it. How do I get that, man? It was just me being real. That’s all that was. I wanted to be a black guy. I thought I was black. I thought I was a black guy. Even to this day, I still have a lot of black friends, and I got to tell you… Every time I talk to my black guy friends, I’m always like, ‘Hey, man, don’t date white girls.’ Don’t date white girls. Not ’cause I’m racist. I’m clearly not racist. I have black friends. I’m not a racist. I tell my black guy friends to not date white girls ’cause I genuinely care about the future of sports. That’s it. We don’t need any placekickers and long snappers. We want dunk contests, right? How do you get a Heisman? You know what I mean? Not from Jerome and Cassie. Jerome and Jaquanda… That’s how we’re gonna make a Heisman, two beautiful chocolate people making love under a beautiful chocolate rain shower while he’s got shoes on. We know the formula. We know the formula. Drake is the number-one dude in hip-hop. His name is Aubrey. Yeah! We let him get away with that. Drake’s name is Aubrey, and nobody said shit about it. Aubrey, number one in hip-hop. What’s his name, Aubrey? Got it. Okay, cool. We’re good. He had beef with Meek Mill. It was a big beef. You’re it. Tag, you’re it. You’re it. Tag. Remember real beef? You remember when hip-hop was, like, real beef? People hated each other. Tupac and Biggie hated each other so much, and they were best friends at one point. They had real beef so deep that Tupac started a song called ‘Hit ‘Em Up’… Before he started the lyrics, he goes, ‘So I fucked your bitch, you fat motherfucker.’ That’s what he said. You’re fat. Fucked your girlfriend. Okay, let’s go. Here we go. That’s crazy. That’s how much he hated that guy. That’s real beef. I feel like hip-hop has, like, dissipated, you know. It’s just, like, gone by the wayside, and I blame one person for the death of hip-hop. His name is Macklemore. That dude is the worst. That dude is the worst. Macklemore is at fault for all this shit going south. Macklemore is not hip-hop. You can like him, but he’s not hip-hop, okay? That’s pop. He talks about going downtown on a scooter with his pals. Come on, bro. What? You’re gonna go downtown with your buddies on a scooter, Macklemore? That’s not hip-hop. Hip-hop doesn’t go downtown. Hip-hop lives downtown, and it goes to the suburbs and robs those people and comes back downtown. It doesn’t go downtown. Talking about thrift stores. Fuck you, bro. Don’t fucking talk about discount clothing! No! I don’t want to hear that, man. I want to hear a rapper be like… And I’m like, ‘You got it, you got it.’ That’s what I want to hear, man. I want to hear Rick Ross be like… That’s what I want to hear. Get out of here, Macklemore. What’s wrong with you, bro? This guy’s bullshit. We can’t call him hip-hop. It’s crazy that he’s hip-hop, ’cause it’s not. It’s all some sensitive-ass shit. The thing that made me t',\n",
       "  'he most mad about Macklemore is he co-wrote this song he got a Grammy nomination for that arguably made him famous, right? It made him famous, right? It was called ‘Same Love.’ It was about same-sex marriage. Now, the song and the depth of the song I’m not against. I’m for same-sex marriage. I don’t give a shit who you want to marry, okay? You want to marry who you want to marry? Go crazy, man. You don’t fuck kids or animals, I don’t care. That’s it for me. No kids, no animals, we’re straight. You want to marry your toaster? Go crazy. Just don’t return that. I don’t want to buy that fucked toaster. So the song I’m okay with. It’s at the beginning of the song, the intro. He goes, ‘When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay.’ Remember this bullshit? I thought that I was gay. When I was in the third grade, I thought I was a gay person. That’s what he said. I thought I was one of you fellas. Thank God I’m not. I’m not, but I thought I was. I thought so. I hated that. I hated that ’cause they applauded him. They were like, ‘Oh, how bold. ‘How brave of Macklemore. ‘He thought he was a homosexual. ‘In third grade, he thought he was a homosexual. ‘He’ s not, which is good, but he thought he was. He thought he was a gay.’ And they thought that was, like, a risky thing to say… ‘I thought I was gay when I was in third grade.’ I hate that shit. You remember third grade? I do. Everybody was gay. Everybody in here in third grade was gay. You were all gay. I wore sweat pants. I played the recorder. I was very gay. I used to Rollerblade around my neighborhood, like, ‘Hey, fellas.’ I would fag out all day. Like… I was homosexual, bro. It wasn’t a question. It was a fact. That kid’s gay as shit. Little redhead gay kid skating backwards. I was gay, man. I was gay when I was in third grade. You were all gay in third grade. I would beg my mom to let me sleep at other boys’ houses every night of the week. I want to sleep at Billy’s. What are you doing over there? None of your business, Mom! Make the call, please! I was so gay in third grade. If another boy accused me of liking girls, I’d fucking murder that kid. Chicago, Illinois, I got to go. I’m Andrew Santino. Thank you so much, man. Thank you, guys. I love you, Chicago. Everybody who’s anybody has lived in this building, man. Locals, baby… Jordan, Pippen, Longley, Kerr, Paxton. You know it, dude. Ryne Sandberg used to own and live in one of those big white poles at the top. He would have to slide down for breakfast. Al Capone still lives in the basement. Not dead. It’s now called Willis, used to be called Macy’s Tower, after the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, because most of the floats are made right here in this building. It’s actually anatomically to scale… even his balls. The penis is not. They ran out of clay, but the balls are full. And if you look right beyond me, that’s the Adams Street Bridge, named, of course, after the Addams Family. Duh-na-na-na. Oh, you want a fat dick in a bun or a little dick in a bun? I don’t want any penises on the hot dog, just a regular hot dog. Okay, we’re gonna give you a Trump dog, then.\\nGonna give me a Trump dog?\\nDamn right. You know what? Let me tell you something.

Thank you. Thank you, San Francisco. Thank you so much. So good to be here. People were surprised when I told ’em I was gonna tape my special in San Francisco. Said, “Why would you do that? That’s the most politically correct city in the world.” Not when I’m on stage, it’s not.\\nI love this place. One of my favorite cities to perform in. It’s a good place to hang out. Got to walk around a little bit today. Saw a baby. Saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. So it’s been a great day. Love that. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a monster. I tried to help the baby. Tried to throw a rock through the window. Window was down. Ruined that baby’s whole weekend. It was worth it.\\nI love San Francisco. One of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. Yeah. Women in San Francisco are gorgeous. I say that despite what’s… going on in this crowd tonight. But you guys live here. You guys live here. You’ve seen ’em. I was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. Like a supermodel. I walked up, I was like, “Hey, where you from? What do you do?” She goes, “Oh, me? I live here in San Francisco. I’m a brain surgeon.” I don’t know if this makes me sexist, but I was really impressed. You know? I mean… Most women… can’t pull off sarcasm. This is gonna be a good show. See, that joke, that joke is a test. To see if you guys are cool or not. That thing about the baby in the car, that’s just me clearing my throat. That joke’s the test. If you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. You don’t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. And I’ve had shows go very, very bad. Doesn’t matter to me at all.\\nNow, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. I, uh… I used to have a son. Already some of you see where this is going, that’s good. That’s good. I used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. The same way Eric Clapton’s son died. For inspiration. I’m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. You guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. Then started clapping, that is amazing. Most people just boo me. But if you didn’t understand the joke… don’t worry. It’s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. That joke is like an onion. You’ve gotta know who Eric Clapton is. Not a given these days. You’ve gotta know about his kid. You gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. You gotta know about that terrible fucking song. And then you gotta think all that’s funny.\\nNow, I gotta get to know you guys a little bit. Starting with you for sure. I can tell you’re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. Did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? What is your name? – Peggy Jo. – Peggy. Peggy, what do you try to do? Not a lot, I’m disabled. You’re disabled? I know you’re disabled. Is this your husband with you? Okay. Sir, what do you do\",\n",
       "  \", so I can move the fuck on. – I’m an electrician. – You’re an electrician? Great. That’s an honorable job. That’s a good job to have. I’m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. Electrician. It’s a wonderful job. There’s a lot of bad jobs out there, I’ll tell you that right now. Lot of bad jobs. Hell, my Uncle John runs a summer camp for… kids about to get molested. I know, right? I know, it sounds awful. Sounds awful, but he loves it. He’s like… Says he’s never worked a day in his life. Doesn’t pay much, but the benefits…\\nDo you guys have any kids? How many? I have one, and he has two. Okay. You guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offenders live around you? Isn’t it crazy? Isn’t it way more than you’d think? You think it might be like one or two. No, it’s like chicken pox. I went online, 15 child molesters. Fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. So, why do we always have to meet at my place? And if you’re wondering, “Anthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?” I don’t know, probably. Seems like something I would do.\\nI of course live in Los Angeles. I’ve got a nice place. Obviously. My brother’s been staying with me, which has been awful. My brother is crazy. Even my neighbors hate him. The other day I opened the door, I caught him masturbating. He looks me right in the eyes and goes, “Shut the door.” I said, “Get inside.” My family loves it when I put them in jokes. They love it. “Anthony, please, put me in your next joke.” “Are you sure? I’m gonna make you a pedophile.” “We don’t care. We wanna be part of this thing you’ve got going on.” So I wrote that joke, put my brother in. I’m in Chicago, where he lives. After the show, he comes backstage and I say, “Mikey, what’d you think about that new joke? Did you like the shout out?” And he gets all uncomfortable. He goes, “Well, crowd seemed to think it was funny… but I think it’s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.” And I said, “What, Mikey? No! No, Mikey. You’re my brother. That’s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.” And he goes, “Yeah, and then you’re like, ‘Get back inside.'” Just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother’s a fuckin’ idiot.\\nYeah, I’ve got a nice place. Try to keep it nice. Not always successful. Like, I tried getting a puppy. Disaster. Had to get rid of that puppy. Had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. The first time I left it home alone, the first time I left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. Why are you mad? I’m the one who couldn’t get his money back. And this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. After I kill a puppy with neglect. And it’s okay. It’s okay, you can get mad at me. You can hate me. You can hate me and still laugh at me. That’s how talented I am. And I’m used to it. I’m used to it.\\nI once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. Once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. I didn’t do anything about it. I didn’t say anything about it. I just turned around and left the room. But in my head, in my head, all I was thinking was… “Now we’re even.” She was so mad. She got mad at me. She got mad at me ’cause I killed all of her plants. Killed every single one of her house plants. And she had told me. She said, “Anthony, I’m going out of town for two weeks. Give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.” But I’m a dude. All I heard was “two weeks” and “cheat on me.” Like my neighbors in L.A… My neighbors in L.A. have got this smokin’ hot 18-year-old daughter. I mean, she’s perfect. But she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. Which is horrible. Doesn’t she understand how dumb that’s gonn\",\n",
       "  'a look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? Yeah, that’s a joke. That’s a joke where I’m a serial killer. I’m very open about it. Don’t you dare tighten up on me.\\nI hate sensitivity. I hate it. Even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. I got a six-year-old nephew. I asked what he wants for his birthday. He said, “Uncle Anthony, I want you to get me a Barbie doll.” I said, “Fuck you.” “You six-year-old piece of shit.” And don’t get me wrong. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t care if he plays with dolls. He can wear dresses if he wants to. But I’m not getting him a Barbie doll. You see, Barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations… …of how easy it’s gonna be to tear off a head. I won’t do it.\\nI get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. If you’re sensitive about comedy, it’s the dumbest thing you can do. I call them the joke police. They always have one rule, one rule they have. You can’t make fun of this right now. After a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it’s so hypocritical. Like the thing today, the thing right now you can’t make fun of, the thing that’s too sensitive at this moment? Trans-gendered people. See? You can’t do it. Can’t make fun of them. It’s too sensitive. In fact, you can’t even call them “chicks with dicks” anymore. No. No. You have to call them “men who talk too much.” Right? But I hear this all the time. People’ll be like, “Anthony, that was really funny. But, man, women must hate you. Women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.” And I always say, “No. No. Stupid women hate my shows.” “Stupid women hate my shows. Smart women… don’t come to my shows.” Speaking of which, what’s your name? – What? Kim. – Kim. – Kim, where you from? – San Jose. San Jose? Okay. What do you do, Kim? Um, I’m a branch manager. – Like for a bank? For a Pizza Hut? – No, for… What? What the fuck? Where’d you go to school? – UC Santa Cruz. – What’d you study? – Economics. – Economics? Okay. You ever gonna use that someday?\\nI had to go to Catholic school when I was a kid. Hated Catholic school. Hated Catholic school more than anything. The nuns were vicious. They would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. Anything to defend themselves. You guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? Hated school. When I was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. Came down with the cancer. Which was sad. But the story is actually cool and inspiring. Every single guy… Every single guy in the school, we all… shaved our heads to make fun of him. Yeah. No, it was great. It was great, we did it for like a month. We would have kept doin’ it, but you know. You know how cancer gets.\\nYou guys ever… You guys ever trace back your family history? Go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn’t know? I traced my family tree back, found that I actually had family fighting on both sides in World War II. Humiliating. The piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the Nazi infantry in Germany, while the bad-ass Jeselniks were here in America spying for the Germans.\\nI assume everyone is drinking tonight? – Yeah! – Yeah! Whoo! That’s good. I love to drink. Love it. Do it all the time, every day, always have. I don’t know where it comes from either. Even my parents tell me, when I was just a little baby, I used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet… to try to spend time with them.\\nI like San Francisco, so liberal. So liberal. Clap your hands here. Clap your hands if you own a gun. San Jose is in the house, huh? Not too bad. I once asked the crowd in Houston that question. They just started firing guns in the air. Didn’t even let me finish the question. I don’t own a gun. I’m against guns, to be honest. When I was a kid… When I was a kid, my paren',\n",
       "  'ts had a gun. My parents said we had to have a gun. Gotta have a gun to protect the five children. Gotta have a gun to protect our five children. Of course, they eventually got rid of it… to protect their four children. I’m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. I was getting pretty good towards the end.\\nMan, my parents were strict. Mom and dad were strict. My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. I learned a lot from my parents. Especially my dad. Like, I’ll never forget… the first time I ever got a bad report card in school. First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. Beat the hell out of me. But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom. Let her take the hit. Yeah.\\nMy dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don’t take classes. You don’t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out. Like, when I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR.\\nAs a kid, my dad’s prized possession, my dad’s favorite thing in the world growing up? My dad was the proud owner of a Mickey Mantle rookie card. Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. Kept it between two little pieces of plastic. But I was a kid. I didn’t know any better. One day I took that card to school and I traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. You know what that card is worth today? My relationship with my father.\\nI mean it, my dad was no joke. My dad did not fuck around. My dad did not trust anybody. My dad did not trust anyone. In fact, he had a saying… but he wouldn’t tell me. What, too clever for you? That joke is fuckin’ amazing.\\nLast year was a sad year for my family. Last year, my mom should’ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. But because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. It was sad.\\nWhen I was a kid, I used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. When I was a kid, we were poor. So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. Of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody. Weird joke to clap for, but sure. My mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.\\nI mean, don’t get me wrong, I loved my mother. She was my mom, of course I loved her. We fought a lot. My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That’s ignorance and I hate that. When I was a kid, like nine years old, I’d come home after school. Once in a while, I’d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. Once in a while, I’d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She’d pull me aside and say, “Anthony, who’s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?” And I would say, “Shut up, Mom, that’s racist. Put your money away.”\\nI never get to see my family anymore, really. Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘Cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony.\\nYou. – What’s your name? – Melissa. – Melissa, where you from? – Santa Clara. – What do you do? – I win things on the radio. – You win things on the radio? – Yeah. Follow-up question, how’d you get tickets to this? Let me ask you this. You ever, uh… you ever find a body in the woods? Ever do that? No? It’s okay. I have. I was walking through the woods one day and… some poor ba',\n",
       "  'stard had stepped in a bear trap or something. I never told anybody about it. But I went back there a week later, and he was dead. Yeah. I do crazy shit like that all the time. What can I say? I’m wacky.\\nThe other night I was driving my car. I was driving my car and I ran over a deer… a dear, dear friend.\\nI’m torn constantly. At night, I do shows, but during the day, I’ve got a hobby. During the day, I go from town to town… and I shut down the local abortion clinic. You heard me. I shut down abortion clinics everywhere I go. It’s easy for me. I’m charming. I stand outside the front doors all day long and… consistently underbid them.\\nYou guys mad about that one? It’s gonna get so much fuckin’ worse. Gotta talk to one more person. You, sir. What’s your name? – Allan. – Allan, where you from? – Frisco. – Frisco. I can tell you’re a local ’cause of how cool you are. What do you do, Frisco? – I fight fires. I fight fires. – You what? You’re a firefighter? Awesome. What do you wanna do? If you could do anything. If you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? – Travel the world. – Travel the world. It’s good to have a dream. I hope you go for it. It doesn’t sound like you’re even gonna get close. I think you should do it. Travel the world. Do it.\\nEveryone should try to live their dream, that’s my point. Everyone. I get to live my dream. I mean, not when I’m in San Francisco, but for the most part. Being a comedian was my dream. ‘Cause no one can tell me what to do. That’s all I cared about. Most people don’t ever try to live their dream. Lot of people try and they fail. Which I think is better, more noble, more respectable.\\nI had an uncle. All he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about… wanted to become an astronaut. Fly into space one day. And he went for it. He went for it. And he failed. He blew it. Ended up becoming one of those pussies… …on the Space Shuttle Challenger. You guys remember that, right? I think it’s funny.\\nI think it’s funny how the things that happen to us when we’re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. I got this little niece. When she was three years old, she almost drowned. And now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. Yeah, I was babysitting her… and trying to do laundry. And she accidentally fell into the washing machine. Thought I was quick. I got good reflexes. I thought I got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. Turned everything pink.\\nYou’re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. Hey, did you guys know… Did you guys know that when a newborn baby… when a newborn baby is first born, when it’s fresh out of the womb… it can actually hear and see everything around it… for up to ten seconds after it’s decapitated? Yeah. Yeah. I never know what to say. I never know what to say to someone after they’ve lost a baby. What do you say to someone after they’ve lost a baby? “Oh, I’m sorry for your loss”? Doesn’t cut it. “Are you gonna be okay?” Not even close. That’s why I just keep my mouth shut. Let my lawyer do the talking.\\nI’m not good with kids. That’s my point. That’s what this whole thing’s about. I’m not good with kids. Not gonna lie. Hell, a couple of months ago, I dropped my cousin’s baby. Flat-out dropped my cousin’s baby on the ground. But I don’t feel like that was my fault. I don’t feel responsible for that one, you know? Who in their right mind… who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me, Anthony Jeselnik, to be a pallbearer?\\nIt’s okay, people hate… people hate dead baby jokes. They hate them. They hate them. It’s like, “Anthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? Why do you have so many dead baby jokes?” “No one likes them, why do you insist?” Well, I’ll tell you why. Because dead baby jokes have made me rich.\\nAnd who was it? Wh',\n",
       "  'o was it who said the first million is the hardest? Was it Hitler? Didn’t see that one coming, did you? That was a good response. Most audiences just pretend I didn’t say it. But I like it. I like making Hitler jokes. It’s cool for me. I enjoy it. Hell, I lost my grandfather. I lost my grandfather in the Holocaust Museum. It was the Holocaust Museum of Modern Art. Which is just like a normal Holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, “Oh! I should have thought of that.”\\nMy grandmother died about a year ago. And I didn’t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. But I was wrong. It was fine. The hard part, the upsetting part… was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. She wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh… You, radio winner. What’s the best way you can die? This is not a trick question. – In your sleep? – Yes, thank you. Thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. Not me. I want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. But my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. We thought that’s how she went. We were all excited for her. But then we did an autopsy. Found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. During an autopsy. It was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. She always said her grandkids didn’t pay enough attention to her and… and she was right. She was dead on.\\nBut I loved my grandma. Loved her very much. My grandma taught me about a lot. Taught me what religion is. Taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. I’ll tell you now. When I graduated from high school… When I graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, “Anthony, I’m so proud of you. You’re my first grandchild to get to go to college. What can I do for you, what can I give you before you go to college?” And I said, “Honestly, Grandma, all I need from you is money.” Yeah, I know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. And my grandma said, “Okay, Anthony, I understand.” Couple months go by. It’s the end of summer. I’m packing up my dad’s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. Says, “Anthony, here, before you leave, take this.” And she handed me a brand-new Bible. King James Version. And I said, “Thanks, Grandma, that’s exactly what we talked about.” I got in the car and I went off to school. Couple of weeks go by, I’m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, just calling to see how college is going.” “Grandma, college is the best. I’m having the time of my life. But to be honest, I’m starting to run low on money, and I could use a little bit, like we talked about.” She said, “Okay, well let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Totally, Grandma, I’m on chapter four.” She said, “Okay, Anthony, I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Hung up the phone. Couple of months go by. Now I’m really starting to struggle financially. Might have to drop out of school, so I call my grandma in a panic. I say, “Please, it’s Anthony. I’m having the time of my life in college. But if I wanna graduate, and I do, I need you to send me some money like we talked about.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Yes, Grandma! I wish it was longer!” And she said, “Okay, Anthony. I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Finally, it’s the end of the school year. I’ve got straight A’s, but I’m dropping out of college, ’cause I have no more money left. And I’m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, I heard you’re dropping out of school today. How come?” And I said, “You know goddamn well how come, Grandma! ‘Cause you wouldn’t give me any money.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask yo',\n",
       "  'u this: Did you read your Bible?” And I just hung up the phone. I was so pissed off. Took everything out of that room. Last thing I took off the shelf, the last thing I took out of that room, was that Bible my grandma had given me. Took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, I actually opened it up. And on the very first page, in my grandmother’s handwriting, it said, “Fuck you.”\\nThank you everyone. I hope you enjoyed the jokes I prepared for you tonight. And all the jokes I write, they’re all made up, they’re all fake, except for Eric Clapton and the Challenger. Everything else… everything else is fake. But everything I’m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that’s all true. Now… I don’t tell dark jokes because I’m a comedian. I’m a comedian because I tell dark jokes. I’m kind of fucked up, all right? I’ve always been this way. I can’t really help myself. It gets me into trouble a lot. I lose friends. It’s ruined relationships with people in my family. For instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. I did love her very much. She was a big fan of mine. And I was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. Horrible mistake. No one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral. I asked a friend for advice. Was like, “I’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?” “Anthony, just go up there and tell a story. Find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. And don’t tell a joke. Try not to.” So I walked up and was like, “You know what my favorite memory was? When I was like four years old, before I learned to read, Grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this Southern accent, and she would read to me. She would read Mark Twain to me, and I loved it. Like… Mark Twain out of my grandma’s mouth, it would just come to life.” And then I couldn’t help myself. I said, “And I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘N’ word.” Now I promise you… I promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a Methodist Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi… you are not a real comedian. I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I’m one of the best comedians of all time. But here’s the thing. It doesn’t matter if you believe me. It really doesn’t matter. The important thing is that I would pass a lie detector test. I like to test myself.\\nI like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. One of my favorite ways to test myself, I like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. The day they happen. I don’t believe in too soon. I’m on a tight schedule. And I’m good at it. I’m good at it. Like, the day of… the day of the Aurora, Colorado Batman movie theater shooting. The day it happened, I went online, I went on Twitter, and I tweeted “Other than that, how was the movie?” Right? Right? Nailed it. Nailed it. And the reason I get away with that… the reason I get away with stuff like that is I’m just the guy who does it. People are used to it from me. It would be weird if I didn’t make a joke the day of a tragedy. Which is why I was very surprised when I got in a lot of trouble the day of the Boston Marathon. Now, I don’t follow the news regularly. But I know the second a tragedy happens because I get 25 text messages saying, “Don’t do it.” And whenever I see that… whenever I see that, it makes me sad. It makes me sad ’cause I know something horrible has happened. People will say, “Anthony, what’s funny about Aurora? What’s funny about the Boston Marathon? What’s funny about your grandmother’s funeral?” Nothing! Nothing is funny about those things. That’s where I come in. So I see the',\n",
       "  'se texts and I’m like, “Oh, no, what happened?” But I also think, “I’ve got a job to do.” So I go online, I start reading about it. I don’t want to watch the footage. But I’ll read about what happened. And I think, “How can I make someone laugh today?” And then I think, “I got it.” I go back on Twitter. And I tweet, “Guys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.” “Especially the finish line.” And again, I think, “Nailed it. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” But then my phone starts to ring. And it’s my boss. Or should I say my former boss. And they say, “Anthony, this is unacceptable. You are not just a comedian today. You’re also the host of your own TV show, with your name in the title, on our network. You take this joke down right now or you’re fired.” And I say, “Go fuck yourselves.” And I meant it. I didn’t get into comedy for money or fame. I know that sounds wrong, because I’m dripping with both. I only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. And they said… Sure. They said, “Well, Anthony, you don’t understand. You don’t understand at all. If you don’t take this joke down right now, if you don’t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they’re also out of a job.” And I’m ashamed to tell you this. I’m embarrassed to admit it. But in that moment, I folded, and I deleted the joke. ‘Cause I’m happy to fight for what I believe in. I’m happy to take the consequences for what I’ve done. But what I could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, “Hey, buddy, no work for you on Monday. I had this sweet tweet.” Couldn’t do it. But as soon as I hit delete, I got mad and I regretted it. I would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, I’ll tell ya that. And I got mad for betraying myself and everything I believe in. I’m just as mad today as I was then. Just as mad. So mad, I had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. They’re like, “Anthony, we’re family. Why are you so upset? Can’t you see we did you a favor? Don’t you worry about your career?” Let me ask you, San Francisco, do I seem like I worry about my career? No. You know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? Because if they’re worried about their money, they wouldn’t have played the lottery in the first fuckin’ place. I do not worry about my career. And they said, “Anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you’re making fun of the victims, and that’s wrong.” But that’s not what I’m doing. Because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I’m wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. No one is ever… No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, “Hey, are we trending?”\\nNo. This is who I’m making fun of when I make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: “My thoughts and prayers…” “My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.” “My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.” Do you know what that’s worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, “Don’t forget about me today.” “Don’t forget about me.” “Lots of crazy distractions in the news, but don’t forget how sad I am.” Those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. They’re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. You understand?\\nNow I’m sure everyone here has told a joke before where',\n",
       "  \" nobody laughed at it. It’s fine. It’s embarrassing, but it’s fun. You can laugh at yourself. It’s not a reason to stop telling jokes. Maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. Trust me, that’s fun too. You guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? Well, I guess that’s what makes me me. On my television show, I once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called “Shark Party.” All right? Now… Some of you enjoyed it, but if you’ve never seen “Shark Party,” you can never see “Shark Party.” It’s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so I will explain it to you. I love sharks. I love sharks more than anything. People… People I can barely fucking tolerate. Every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. Every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? So when I hear about a shark attack, I’m like, “Fuck, yeah.” Win one for the home team. So as soon as I get this show where I can do what I want, I say, “You know what? I want to have a shark party. As soon as there’s a shark attack, we’re having a shark party.” And I get lucky. About a month into my run, this guy from New Zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. And I know exactly what to do. I’ve already got the script written. I walk on stage, in front of the cameras. I say, “Ladies and gentlemen, this guy from New Zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. It’s time for a shark party.” Lights go down, music comes up. Six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. For way too long. A stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. Very tasteful. And then I stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. Which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. But I get to say my favorite thing I’ve ever said on television: “Smile, you son of a bitch. Shark party.” And in America, where I’m famous for those types of shenanigans… everybody was like, “Anthony, that was fucked up.” “It was fucked up to see you dance.” End of controversy. However, in New Zealand, where they don’t get my show, they’ve never seen me, and frankly, they don’t get out much… the New Zealand media takes the video… and they show it to the guy’s family. And they say, “What do you guys think about this?” And they say, “Crikey,” or whatever the fuck they say over there. The point is, all of New Zealand, all of New Zealand rises up against me. All 45 of those cunts rise up. And start threatening my life. Now, I don’t read the things that people write about me on the Internet. But I pay people who do. And they come to me, and they’re like, “We’ve got some terrible news. Please sit down.” They say, “You are getting a lot of death threats online from New Zealand because of ‘Shark Party.'” And I was like, “Really? New Zealand wants to kill me? That’s weird because they didn’t even kill the shark.” I said, “How many death threats am I getting?” And they were like “Oh, all of them. You are getting all of the death threats. What do you want us to do? We can send someone to talk to them. Extra security? What do you want?” I said, “No, forget about it. Leave it alone, don’t worry.”\\nThis might be hard for some to understand. I’ve said it several times tonight. Everyone is going to die. I know full well I am going to die. And most of us don’t get to choose how we check out. But if I die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? Best case scenario. If somebody murders me over one of my jokes, I immediately become a legend. I’m a comedy God. The Mount Rushmore of comedy is me, four times. I said, “Come on then.” My security guys are like, “Okay, Anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we’ve ever heard.” “But you’re the boss. Okay.” And they leave. And then \",\n",
       "  'the next day they come back. And they say “Anthony, sorry to bother you again. I know you didn’t care yesterday, but it’s gotten much worse. You’re gonna wanna hear this.” They say, “Someone from New Zealand tracked down your mom and dad’s phone number and address in Pittsburgh, posted that online… and now your entire family is getting death threats from New Zealand.” And I have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. It never crossed my mind… that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm’s way, for something I’ve done or I’ve joked about. And honestly, I would cut my throat for my jokes. I would give my life for what I do. But if anyone, and I mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone I cared about because of a joke I’ve made? Even better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nAnthony Jeselnik, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t4 thoughts on “Anthony Jeselnik: Thoughts And Prayers (2015) – Full Transcript”\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLuca 20/02/2022 at 01:56  \\n\\n\\nThis man is fantastic\\nI watched the show 10 times  and I laughed so much everytime\\n\\nReply \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAriel 30/03/2022 at 06:11  \\n\\n\\nExcept for the Eric Clapton joke and Sharky Party all is forgivable.

Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What’s going on? Thank you. It’s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It’s nice to be here. I don’t know why I came here in June. It’s nice to be here. Wasn’t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? “Look at ’em just over there, drinkin’ a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!” So… What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I’d go veggie twice a week. It’s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o’clock, that’s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something’s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I’m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It’s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those “V” ones, right? They said it’ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there’s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They’re always doing that shit. You know, “If everybody went vegan, the air would be– If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.” Right? They just won’t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, “Look, 85% of you have to go.” – That’s it! That is it. – [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting… for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won’t do it, they won’t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can’t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can’t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: “And if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers– Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you’re already out!” You can’t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin’ nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. “We’re part of a group, eh.” You gotta apologize. “I’m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn’t mean to say that it’s an ugly-ass dog, nah.” Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There’s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? “I’m gonna join a group, that’s what I’m gonna do today.” Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That’s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It’s like, dude, that’s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? “The Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.” Dude, that’s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don’t know anybody who’s graduating. You’re just fucking sitting there. They’re gonna have the whole list the next day. They’ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. “Yeah, you’re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?” “Well, you know, it’s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it’s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.” Yeah. I’m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin’ blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You’ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to ’em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you’re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, “We like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.” Right? Now I got to tell you something. That’s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn’t work. It’s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don’t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He’s just like, “That’s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That’s what we’re doing.” She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don’t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you’re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can’t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It’s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It’s horrific to watch. You can’t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody… you’re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, “Wait a minute!” [shouts angrily] That’s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they\",\n",
       "  ' drive home? They’re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they’re not reading anything? They don’t see the “Don’t Hit Your Wife” billboard? They’re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? “Make a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.” Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn’t even open his eyes when he’s talking. “Take a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?” He doesn’t even have the nerve to open his eyes. “You want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.” His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody’s getting in trouble ’cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, ’cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There’s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you’re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I’m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. “Once everyone gets in ze pool, ja.” “It was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don’t know, I don’t know how I feel about it.” Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I’m not saying what these people did wasn’t offensive. I’m not sayin’ that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They’re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? “Whoa, whoa, whoa! Let’s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let’s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?” Yeah, they’re old. What did you think they thought? I mean– I’m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I’m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn’t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn’t drop the “N” word once. That’s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The “N” word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape– go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he’s pretty fucking liberal. He’s like, “You can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn’t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. “You can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don’t promote it on Instagram.” “Hey, what about Facebook?” “I don’t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!” Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That’s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy’s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. “Up next, Whitey Willoughby! There’s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.” Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That’s who taught him his ABCs. You know? “~ A, B, C, D, E… ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K… ~” Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he’d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early ’70s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he’s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I’m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940’s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, “Hey, you can hang out with ’em, you can have sex with ’em, man, you know?” His dad’s getting all pissed off: “Let me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.” That’s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that’s it, that’s all you know. ‘Cause right around then, you get married, and it’s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you’re sucked in the bubble. You don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on out in the world. You’re stuck with these kids. “It’s shitting all over the place! Don’t be a serial killer! Don’t touch that!” You’re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble– You don’t know what happened. You’re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you’re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It’s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I’m 46 years old. I don’t even have kids, but I can’t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they’re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I’m like, all right, I’ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don’t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, “What’s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K– Is my stylus gonna work? I don’t know.” So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. “All right, put it on!” Ninety seconds later, I’m like this old man. “Ah, this isn’t music!” You know? “When I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.” Yeah. All ',\n",
       "  'of this shit’s passing me by. I’ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don’t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don’t give a shit, but I’m a sports fan. That’s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you’re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn’t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I’m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can’t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. “Hold still!” “Her ground and pound is incredible.” Yeah. I’m not saying these people are right, and I’m not saying that I’m right. I know I’m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy– I know what he said was wrong, but I don’t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, “Can you believe?” Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I’d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn’t he think… Didn’t he think exactly what you thought… he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin’ kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn’t it come from that shit? There’s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin’ six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth… for someone like me? Right? That’s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it’s not his fault that he went to– He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin’ brainwash you. You know? Don’t clap, don’t clap, I don’t read, I don’t read. Follow someone else. I’m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain’s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. “~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~” “~ All right, I’ll say it ~ ~ I’ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~” Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. “You’re a big boy.” “Looks like people like me!” You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master’s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, “Whack whack!” Mine goes, “Whack-a-fuckin’-whack!” Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he’s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. “Jesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn’t like the queers.” And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he’s like, “That’s what they said!” And they’re all dead. “Oh, where’d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!” He’s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don’t understand. I don’t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it’s Gay Lesbian A… whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don’t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? “Hey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?” They’re not gonna do that. That’s the Vatican. They’re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They’re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it’s nothing. They’re not taking that call. “Oh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.” Click. They don’t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you’re into, you’re into, but I’m not into that religious stuff where– And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn’t like to go– I didn’t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn’t. Part of it was I’m lazy. I don’t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn’t come back yet. You know, we’re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. – Right? – [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually– I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else’s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I’m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don’t kill anybody. Don’t touch my wife. That’s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I’ve broken, I think I’ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that’s it. I haven’t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they’re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh… Shh… Shh… Right? See the whole thing, so we’ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we’re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else’s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there’s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, “That is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.” [man] Yeah! Like, your guy’s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn’t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver’s license, Social Security number. There’s like footage of him stubbing his toe. “Motherfucker!” Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny’s, he got sick of it. “I’ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there’s this spaceship coming back. Everybody’s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We’re gonna try to make you clear, right?” Look, I’m paraphrasing, I’m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that’s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ',\n",
       "  'ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So… Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn’t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We– right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There’s sneakers. There’s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it’s ’cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn’t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? “Ah, son, there is no fat fuck, it’s your mother and I. Your mom’s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don’t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won’t come true!” Right? And I was just like, “Wow, this is how the world is.” And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? “That’s very offensive to me and other Christians and…” Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, “Yeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don’t go anymore.” Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he’s along for the ride, the two of them, they’re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking… That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That’s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn’t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. “And on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures…” I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it’s like, I’m in this weird place where I’m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I’d like to believe in something, so I’ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven’t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they’re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you’re dead and that’s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just– just layin’ there. Over. Blew my mind, I’m like, “Really? You’re just dead?” Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. “Well, I don’t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?” This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I’m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that’s true, that somebody’s gonna judge me, that doesn’t even make any sense. It’s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let’s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don’t think this thing’s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question… your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn’t run, I wouldn’t burn it forever. “You evil piece of shit!” Just light it on fire. I wouldn’t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? “Anything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I’m gonna try and help you out.” Yes, my religion, it’s nuts. It’s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn’t, or some of your friends. Doesn’t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that’s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, “Jesus Christ, where the hell are they? It’s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?” And then one day, it just settles in that they didn’t make it. And then what, I’m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: “Hey, how is it going, everybody? Isn’t this great? Isn’t this great?” “Yeah, Dude, it’d be even better if all my family members and friends weren’t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn’t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. ‘Hey, hey, how is it going over here?’ Why did you come over here? I don’t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don’t give a fuck! I’m already in here, I’m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss’s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.” So yeah, so they believe when you die, you’re dead. And I was like, so you’re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn’t get my head around it. He goes, “Well, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?” And I was like, “No,” and the guy’s like, “Yeah, it’s just like that.” I’m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I’m getting as I get older. I’m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It’s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don’t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don’t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don’t believe in the pilots. ‘Cause you know what? I don’t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, “All right, we’ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We’ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don’t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we’ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you’ll be in a jet–” Whoo! We’re g',\n",
       "  'oing a little faster. Right? Big planes, you’re getting the fuckin’ pilot that knows what he’s doing. He’s probably fought in a war. He’s used to getting shot at. He can’t bring this bus in? It’s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, “My headphones don’t work!” He doesn’t give a fuck, right? He’s up there sleeping. He’s trying to make something happen, he’s so goddamn bored. That’s a stud up there, right? So one time I’m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I’m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like… [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane’s made of, like… All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. “Whoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!” I’m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going… “Whoo! Whaaa! Whoa!” Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I’m praying to a higher power, I don’t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, “Dude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.” Jesus Christ. You know? “You think I’m not up here thinking… ‘Whaaa! Whoa!’ I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?” You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half… whooo… whaaaa… fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it’s all car stuff. “Looking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn’t fit.” “What do you mean the carburetor doesn’t fit? Dad’s gonna be mad.” [yelling gibberish] There’s never enough time to build the car. It’s so fucking stupid. “We got to have this bus done by Thursday!” Or else what? The guy doesn’t want it anymore? All right. “You’ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.” So, before… [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of… whoo… whaaa… bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, ’cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They’re like, “All right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He’s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.” Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. “Well, he’s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.” Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you’re rolling the dice. You’re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, ’cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who’s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you’re gonna turn around. All you’re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don’t know, man, that’s risky. You know, in reality, I’m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, ’cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn’t scream out like he did, and that’s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, “How was your day? What’s wrong?” And all of that shit, you know? That’s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you’re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock ’em down, right? “Come on, it didn’t hurt, get up!” I didn’t come from a family, I don’t know about you guys, I didn’t come from a touchy-feely… “Call me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.” None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged ’cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it’s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I’ll just be driving down the street, just be like… Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There’s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I’m in the shower. I don’t know what it is. I think ’cause I’m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I’ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I’ll just be in the shower just being like… [screaming] And my wife’s always just like, “Is everything okay in there?” I’ll just be like, “Yeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.” “Every day?” So… Yeah… I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, “How come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn’t do that stuff?” She was like, “I wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.” And I was like, “You were afraid?” And she goes, “Well, it was your father. That’s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don’t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that’s what’s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there’s compromises.” Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, ’cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. “Comedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Taber',\n",
       "  'nacle–” Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I’m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don’t have any kids. As far as I’d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn’t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn’t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, “Don’t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?” So he took it from that… and knocked it down to, “Don’t hug him, it’s gonna make him gay.” Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I’ll whittle it down to like, “He’s not taking drama class, all right? He’s not taking drama class ’cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!” I won’t fix everything. And that’s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn’t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn’t. I would send… I’d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can’t fucking do any of that shit unless I’m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody’s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody’s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there’s no way I’m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He’s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He’s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, “There’s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!” I don’t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he’s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. “You ever do that again, I’m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.” All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That’s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I’m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It’s like 45 years old. “My girlfriend, yeah, we’re gonna go out and get some pop.” Going to parties, it was just weird. ‘Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn’t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage… marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, “The superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it’s just…” “It’s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying…” “…with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.” When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I’d just be like, “Did anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat’s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn’t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn’t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?” So now I’m married, so the next move is you’re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I’m 46 years old. I’m just thinking it’s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I’m gonna have a kid, I’m gonna die of natural causes when the kid’s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. “We used to use these on a Saturday.” Do a face plant. My kid’s standing there, “Mom, Dad’s sleeping again!” I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don’t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. “Hey, man, it’s kind of cold out today.” “Dude, you don’t understand. You don’t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you’re trying to get chocolate off the other one’s face.” “All right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?” “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I’m actually thinking of doing, I’m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn’t have to be brand-new. You know? It’s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I’d love to adopt. It’s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I’m not telling any of my friends. I’m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss ’em off. “Mine just turned six.” “Mine just turned seven.” I’d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, “Dominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don’t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They’re just there, like…! With all their issues…!” I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it’s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an ’07, ’08… always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I’d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn’t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! “Come on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You’re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you’re coming home with me!” Yeah. Dude, how easy… how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he’s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. “Have a seat.” He’ll be like, “I get to sit down?” “Yeah, lay down on the couch.” He’ll be like, “It’s like a cloud! It’s like a cloud!” I’ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop spor',\n",
       "  'ts. I don’t know. The kid would love me. So that’s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I’d probably get like an ’05 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That’s how fucked up the world is, there’s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that’s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what’s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I’m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris… standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They’re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can’t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I’d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? “I said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I’m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You’ve been out of line all day, mister! Don’t even start that shit! Don’t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I’ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? ‘Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he’s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn’t, he doesn’t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn’t. Because he doesn’t sleep in the bed, he’s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don’t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don’t even start that shit, all right? All right, you’re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn’t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he’d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can’t give him back, it doesn’t work that way. There he is, there he is! What’s up, buddy? What’s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You’re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?” So I figure, uh… I don’t know if I’ll do it. Maybe I’m too selfish. I have no idea. I’m all over the fuckin’ map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that’s my latest thing. You know why it is? It’s ’cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it’s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There’s not even zoning laws. They’ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there’s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn’t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You’re all right. I don’t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You’re on the outskirts, you’re fine. You’re fine. You don’t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you’re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there’s nowhere to go. That’s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate “fuck this, I’m out” vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? “Fuck this! This looks safe.” You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She’s just like, “Yeah, no.” Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, “Oh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so… there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren’t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?” Yeah, I’m still gonna do it, I’m just not gonna tell her. I’m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I’m not going to tell her. I’m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She’s just gonna be like, “What is that? What is that for? What does that mean?” “Yeah, someday you’ll see, someday you’ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you’re freaking the fuck out, and I’m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.” “What is that?” “Shut the fuck up and get in!” Now you guys think I’m bullshitting, I’m not. I’m serious. I’m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I’m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them… doing key bumps and shit. “They’re after me! Swear to God!” I’m seeing stories about them! It’s just like that old advertising anecdote. “I never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they’re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.” It’s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years– 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. “I built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.” “All right, Dad, I love you.” All right? This poor kid, five days in, he’s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he’s like, “I need the money. I gotta give him a tour.” Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. “We love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.” Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. “All right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that’s Orange County. There’s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don’t, don’t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!” Air traffic control: “I do',\n",
       "  'n’t know who’s on this frequency, but you really need–” “Somebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!” Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn’t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. “Take me up in a chopper, I’m looking at the land I love, and then I’m jumping out like a superhero.” I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can’t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, “Fuck you, disease. I decide.” Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. “Take me up in the chopper.” He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He’s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? “Over 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don’t try to open the door. No, no, don’t, don’t, don’t!” [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here’s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You’d think that would be enough so, I’m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just… But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn’t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he’s got to be thinking, “Three more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!” Wham! [agonized scream] “Oh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!” It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That’s right. So here’s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I’ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn’t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn’t want– Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I’m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can’t fucking have some .357 hanging around. “I’ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!” Can’t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, ’cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that’s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You’re laughing at that, sir? That’s not enough? I don’t know. I’m down South. What do you think? That’s not enough, right? You want– Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You’re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. “What’s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.” All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns… have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you’re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? ‘Cause that’s what’s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You’re not gonna have time to be, “Hang on a second, let me just…” Yeah, you’re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy’s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. “Hey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There’s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.” You know what’s funny? Every other state is fuckin’ dying laughing at this point in the joke because it’s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, “All right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You’re reading from your journal? I don’t understand what the– It’s not a real compelling story.” I’m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, “Let’s shoot it at a burned-out car!” Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I’m like, all right, let’s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was… [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn’t get louder, didn’t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let’s take one of your fucking guns. Let’s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God’s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don’t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho’s coming in too, right? That’s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don’t come by at 6:30 at night, as you’re cutting into a pork chop. “I’m out of my mind, I’m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies ’cause it’s gonna get crazy.” That’s not how it works. They wait till you’re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let’s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You’re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you’re just… [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he’s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears… [snoring] He’s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you’re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like… [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] “What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter? What’s the matter, boy? You hear something? What’s the matter? What are you barking for? You’re shakin',\n",
       "  'g. What’s the matter, huh? You hear something? What’s–? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.” [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can’t see, now you can’t hear. That’s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You’re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won’t get off the fact that it’s a fuckin’ .22. You’re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me– I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a ‘roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody’s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don’t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don’t give a fuck how tough you are. I don’t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That’s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. “Look, I’m coming back, I’m coming back!” I’ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I’m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I’m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I’m keeping some fight in me. I’m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, “I guess we’re making holiday cookies.” That dude with the bowed shoulders. “She makes them and then I’m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don’t even think they taste that good, but just–” No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, “You can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.” I couldn’t believe it. It’s one of the most arrogant things I’ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. “You can just sleep downstairs.” Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. “All right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?” It’s like, are you out of your mind? I go, “I’m not sleeping downstairs.” She’s like, “Where you gonna sleep, then?” I’m like, “Where I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I’m bigger than you. I’ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!” Yeah, I was like, “You don’t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.” She’s like, “Well, you don’t tell me where to sleep.” I’m like, “I’m not the one telling people where to sleep!” It was one of those classic relationship fights. It’s like 2:00 in the morning, you’re both half naked. She’s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. “And another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!” It’s fuckin’ unreal, but what kills me is that there’s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they’ll be, “Hey, how’s it been going?” “It’s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?” No, I don’t. I don’t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you’re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She’s gonna come at you. “Well, let’s get you in an arm bar.” “All right, all right, all right!” Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. “I fucking hate when she does this. It’s like, it’s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.” All right? I’m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who’s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there’s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can’t physically dominate you, so that’s gone. What’s the next fear? She’s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It’s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. “Join me!” Yeah. I’ve never understood that threat. That’s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what’s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can’t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. “Here she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.” She’s never body-slammed me once, ever. I’m not saying to be a dick. All right? I’m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. “Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.” Rest of the shit– I’m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything’s cool, everything’s cool, just, “Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I’m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I’m talking to people, I am having a good time here.” That’s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here’s an olive branch I’ve extended to her. It’s basically… We fight a lot over television. I’ve kind of come her way, she’s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don’t care, the nerd’s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I’ll watch it, right? I don’t mind them, it’s an uplifting story. I just don’t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They’re just so fucking nice. It’s, like, missionary-style. There’s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? ‘Cause they can’t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% o',\n",
       "  'f her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman’s sexuality. That’s never brought up. That whole “Hold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.” That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don’t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn’t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like… And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn’t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, “What are you doing?” She says, like, “I don’t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It’s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don’t you want to do it? It’ll be fun.” Why don’t I want to do it? I don’t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. “Yeah, she’s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!” Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they’ll do is every once in a while, they’ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn’t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. “Oh, my God, it’s the wall. Oh, my God! It’s supporting me, maybe he’ll support me, it’s a metaphor, I love it.” Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I’m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I’m like, “That is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.” What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she’s gonna do is this, she’s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that’s what she’s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they’re like, “All right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can’t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.” These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they’re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I’m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you’re heavy. You’re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they’re, like, five or six? “Get off of me! Jesus Christ. You’re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.” An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it’s not balanced weight. Most of it’s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head’s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don’t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. “Fuckin’ yeah!” Yeah, it’s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it’s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You’re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don’t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe’s ruined, and you’re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I’m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I’ll see you next time. Thank you.

Please. Oh, sit down. Sit yo asses down. Please let me get on with the show. It’s nice to be here. Brooklyn.\\nHere’s my question. You would think… You would think… You would think the cops would occasionally shoot a white kid… just to make it look good. You would think that every couple of months they’d look at their dead n i g g a calendar and go… “Oh, my God, we’re up to 16. We gotta shoot a white kid quick.” “Uh, which one?” “The first one you see singing Cardi B.” That’s right. I mean, honestly, I wanna live in a world… with real equality. I wanna live in a world… where an equal amount of white kids are shot every month. An equal world. I wanna see white mothers on TV crying. Standing next to Al Sharpton. Talking about, “We need justice for Chad. We need justice for Chad. He was just coming home from racquetball practice.” I know some people like, “Come on, Chris, man. You go too hard on the cops, man. You’re a celebrity. I’m sure they let you go. I’m sure they’re nice to you, man. You a celebrity.” Yeah, I’m famous, you know. But I’m not, like, Michael Jackson, famous. I’m not famous from miles away. Like, my fame kicks in right about here. You know? When the cops see me walking down the street, they’re like, “N i g g a, n i g g a, n i g g a, n i g g a, n i g g a… Hey, that’s Chris Rock! Man, you are funny, man. I love Pootie Tang, man.”\\nIt’s weird, man. It’s weird. You know, this whole thing with the cops, man, ’cause… You know, as a black man, especially a grown black man, I have a weird relationship with the cops, man. Like, on one hand I’m a black man so I’m like, “Fuck the police.” And on the other hand, I own property. You know, if somebody comes and breaks in my house, I’m not calling the crips. Uh, yo, crips… can you send Lil’ JJ down? Oh, he’s here already. My bad. My bad.”\\nI mean, here’s the thing with the cops, though, I mean, being a cop is a hard job, man. It’s a hard fucking job, man. I mean, honestly, I don’t think they pay cops enough. I don’t think they pay police enough.\\n[scattered clapping]\\nAnd you get what you pay for. Here’s the thing, man. Whenever the cops gun down an innocent black man… they always say the same things, man. They always say the same thing. It’s like, “Well, it’s not most cops. It’s just a few bad apples.” It’s just a few bad apples. Bad apple? That’s a lovely name for murderer. It’s like, how’d they get that one? “Bad apple?” That almost sounds nice. I mean, I’ve had a bad apple. It was tart. But it didn’t choke me out. Here’s the thing. Here’s the thing. I know it’s hard being a cop. I know it’s hard. I know that shit’s dangerous. I know it is, ok? But some jobs can’t have bad apples. Ok? Some jobs, everybody gotta be good. Like… pilots. -[scattered clapping] -You know? American Airlines can’t be like, “Most of our pilots like to land. We just got a few bad apples… that like to crash into mountains. Please bear with us.”\\nAmerica’s insane, man. Cops shooting motherfuckers, man. You know, we got cop problems. We got the gun problems. This gun shit ain’t going nowhere, ok? I',\n",
       "  't’s like, “Gun control.” There ain’t never gonna be no gun control, ok? You talk about it too long and you will get shot. They will shoot yo ass, ok? That’s right. They never, ever changing the gun laws. Because Americans need the right to hunt. They need to hunt. It’s like, “Really?” Hunting’s that fucking important? I mean… I’ve been hunting. I’ve been hunting. I used to hunt with my grandfather as a kid in South Carolina. Went hunting with my grandfather. Uh, I shot a rabbit. I cried. He called me a faggot. And he’s a preacher. They will shoot 100 people in Vegas, ok? And somebody will come on TV. You know, and they’ll just talk like… “Hey, you know, guns don’t kill people. People kill people. As a matter of fact, if the gunman would’ve had a knife… he could’ve stabbed 100 people to death. Could’ve stabbed 100 people? Yo, check this out. Check this out. If 100 people ever got stabbed, at the same time, in the same place by the same person, you know what that would mean? Ninety-seven people deserved to die. What? You just watching this shit? “Oh shit, somebody got stabbed. Oh, they stabbed somebody else. Oh, he stabbed somebody else. Oh, he getting closer. Oh, he stabbed me. I didn’t see that coming. Oh, he stabbed the lady behind me. He’s a stabbin’ fool. Guess that’s why they call him Stabby.”\\nYo, it is so good to be here right now. Glad to be back. Here’s the weird thing. I’ve been so busy, man. I’ve been busy. People like, “Where you been? Been busy, trying to raise some kids. That shit’s a job. Now, my oldest daughter just started high school. Just started high school. Lola just started high school. And, uh, yep, kept her off the pole. And, uh… Kept her off the pole, you know. She danced a little too hard to Migos, but we’re working on it. She just started high school and I had to take her to freshman orientation. You ever go to freshman orientation? It’s the most boring thing you will ever do with your kids. You know, ’cause you sit in an auditorium quite like this. With, you know, a couple thousand kids. People come up and speak and just lie to children. That’s all that happens all day is people come up and lie to children about the future. And I’m sitting there and this lady comes up and goes, “I want you children to know you can be anything you wanna be. You can be absolutely anything you wanna be.” I’m like, “Lady, why are you lying to these children?” Maybe four of them could be anything they wanna be. But the other 2,000 better learn how to weld. Shit, I’m looking at these kids right now. I count at least 60 Uber drivers. They could be anything they wanna be. Shut the fuck up. Really? They could be anything they wanna be? Then how come you’re a vice principal? Was that the dream? Did you dress up like a vice principal when you was a kid? Put your little vice principal hat on? Tell the kids the truth. Tell the kids the fucking truth. Say, “Hey kids, check this out. Check this out. You can be anything you’re good at. As long as they’re hiring.”\\n[laughter and applause]\\nAnd even then it helps to know somebody.\\nSo, I’m sitting there. I’m in school and I’m watching this shit. And it dawned on me that this orientation wasn’t right. You know, ’cause I got black kids, man. You know, and I’m sitting there, I’m like, “I don’t think this is right.” I think they need separate orientations. I think they need a black orientation, white, gay, straight, Mexican, whatever. Because the black kids, you’re, you’re… You know, you’re getting ready to face a whole other world. I got black kids. I gotta get them ready for the white man. I gotta get them ready for America, man. You know? It’s like, you know. I mean, not the white man that’s here tonight. You guys are alright. Ya’ll cool. Every one of you. I want you to know every dime you spent tonight is going towards putting little black girls through private school. Anybody ask you what you did tonight, you go, “I made a difference.”\\nBut so I’m at school and I’m like, “Yo, I think we need separate orientations.” ‘Cause you gotta get your kids ready for the white man. If you’re not, then you’re fucking up as a parent, ok? I’ve been getting my kids ready for the white man since they was born. Ok? Even before they was born, I’ve bee',\n",
       "  'n preparing them for the white man. Yeah. That’s right. My house, we don’t have fire drills. We have white-r drills. So, ever since my kids were born, I’ve been getting them ready for the white man. So, everything in my house… that’s the color white… is either hot, heavy, or sharp. So, my kids know when they deal with anything white, they gotta think about that shit. They gotta contemplate this shit. “Oh, this napkin, ok. Should I wipe my mouth with it? Or is that what whitey wants me to do?” Ever since they was born, everything in my house, hot, heavy, or sharp. They sit on a white toilet seat. Burn their ass. “Daddy, my ass is burning.” “It’s white motherfucker. It’s white. That’s what whitey do. He burn your fucking ass. Pay attention.” Shit, when they was little girls, their white onesie weighed 150 pounds. [crying] “Daddy! Dad, it’s so heavy. It’s so heavy. This hurts. I can’t even stand. I can’t even stand.” “It’s white, motherfucker. It’s white. That’s what whitey do. He break your back.” At their birthday party, I gave them vanilla ice cream… with glass in it. “Daddy, my tongue’s bleeding.” “Should’ve got chocolate.”\\n[laughter and clapping]\\nYeah, I go hard. I got girls and I go hard. So, if you got a black son, shit, you gotta just punch him in the face. So, as soon as he wakes up in the morning, it’s like, “Morning, n i g g a. Pow.” If you don’t punch your black son in the face, that’s child abuse. It’s rough out there for a black boy, man. It’s rough! That’s right. Some people say young black men are an endangered species. But, that’s not true. Because endangered species are protected by the government.\\n[applause and cheers]\\n[high-pitched] True. That’s right, you got to punch your black son in the fucking face. You understand me? Hard. Yeah, I said it. On Netflix, I said that shit. You understand? It’s important that your black son follow your instructions. It’s the difference between life and death, ok? Ok? Yeah. Yeah, ’cause we got a crazy justice system out here, man. We got a justice system for rich, for poor, for black, for white. We live in a country where two people can do the exact same crime in the exact same place at the exact same time and get a different sentence. Only in America. We gotta change this justice system, yo. The American justice system should be like Walmart. Should be just like Walmart. It’s like, “Hey, if you can find a lighter sentence, we’ll match it.”\\nSo, I’m at the school. I’m at the school. And, the lady comes back out. She goes, “I want you to know that the school has absolutely no bullies. We have a no-bully policy. We don’t– We don’t– We don’t permit bullying. Any bullies will be kicked out of school immediately.” And right then, I wanted to take my daughter out the school. It’s like, “What kind of half-assed education is this?” I mean, school is supposed to prepare you for life. Life has assholes. And you should learn how to deal with them as soon as possible. God forbid, you wait till you’re 30 to find out people ain’t shit. That’s a lesson you need, quick. That’s right.\\nI mean, one of the problems with the world is we got too many people telling they kids how special they are. These souped up kids walking the streets today thinking they’re fucking special. I’m walking down the street, always some kid, “Hey, good work, Chris. Really funny, Chris. Love your work.” I’m like, “It’s Mr. Rock, bitch.” Stop telling your kids that they special. Maybe they special to you. But not to me. I don’t play that shit. Everyday before my kids leave to school, I get them at the door. I’m like, “Lola, Zahra, check this out. Soon as you leave this door, nobody gives a fuck about you. Nobody in the whole world gives a fuck about you. Nobody thinks you’re cute. Nobody thinks you’re smart. Nobody gives a fuck about your opinion. Nobody on the whole earth outside of this door gives a fuck about you.\\n[clapping and laughing]\\nNobody! And even some of the people inside the house… [laughter] …a little on the fence.” We need bullies. How the fuck you gonna have a school with no bullies? Bullies do half the work. That’s right. Teachers do one half. Bullies do the whole other half. And that’s the half you’re gonna use as a fucking grown-up. That’s right. W',\n",
       "  'ho gives a fuck if you can code… if you start crying ’cause your boss didn’t say hi? You fucking weak bitch. Get the fuck away from me.\\nYou think kids were nice to Bill Gates in high school? “Hey, Gates, you Charlie Brown-looking motherfucker. Fuck you, Gates. You four-eyed bitch. Fuck you and your windows, you gape-tooth motherfucker. I’m gonna smack the shit out of you, fucking Gate. Gate motherfucker. You can’t get in the gate, Gates.” You think kids were nice to Mark Zuckerberg in high school? “Hey, Zucker-fuck. Zucker-fucker. Mother-Zucker. Mother. Zuck-Zucker, mother-Zuck. Suck my nuts-er, Zucker. Mother-Zucker. Mother-Zuck. Zucker-mother. Zucker-mother. Mother-Zucker.” He invented Facebook after somebody smacked him in the face with a book. He invented Facebook just to get friends.\\nWe need bullies. Shit, pressure makes diamonds. Not hugs. That’s right. Hug a piece of coal and watch what you get. You get a dirty shirt. I’m telling you, we need fucking bullies. That’s why there’s so many fat kids in school right now. ‘Cause there’s nobody to take their lunch money. You know what they buy with all that money? Seconds. We need bullies, man. I hate when people go, “You know what, cyber bullying is worse.” Shut up. I never heard of anybody getting cyber kicked down a flight of stairs. I’ve never heard of anybody getting a cyber bag of piss thrown at them.\\nWe need fucking bullies. Shit, that’s how Trump became president. That’s exactly what happened. We got rid of bullies. A real bully showed up, and nobody knew how to handle him. [applause and cheers] Shit. The cast of The Apprentice is running the world. Trump, the daughter, Omarosa. They run the world, man. Yo, man, this shit is crazy. A lot of people are like, “Well, Trump is a bad person and he gonna get his”. You know, some people never get theirs. Some people just fail up. People are like, “Well, you know, what goes around comes around.” No, it don’t. Sometimes it just keeps going around. Ain’t nothing gonna happen to Trump, man. Nothing’s gonna happen to Trump. Here’s the crazy thing. It might just work out. Trump might work out. -Yeah, I said it. -[laughing] Trump might work out. I mean, think about it this way. Bush was so bad… he gave us Obama. You forget that shit, don’t you? Bush was so bad that people said, “Hey, maybe this black guy has the answers.” I think people overlook George Bush’s contributions to black history. George Bush is a black revolutionary. Malcolm X, Rosa Parks, George Bush. They need to honor him at the Essence Festival. It might work out, man. Think about it. Bush was so bad he gave us Obama. Shit, Trump’s so bad… he gonna give us Jesus. “Jesus, what you doing here?” “You seen Trump?” This shit is serious.\\nOh, man. Jesus. I’m trying to get my life together, man. I’m trying to get a little religion in my life. Just a little. Just a little. Religion is kinda like salt. A sprinkle is good, but too much will fuck up the meal. I mean, I’m basically trying to find God before God finds me. [laughter, scattered clapping] But, God never finds you at a good time. You’re never sitting court side at a Knick game…. getting a hand job from Halle Berry, and… God shows up. “She strokes a good dick, don’t she? I made her. I made your dick too. Enjoy the game.” God never shows up at those times. No, God shows up after you’ve been raped in jail. And you’re in jail for parking tickets. Now, if you in jail for murder, and somebody’s raping you, you’re like, “Ok, I guess this is what I deserve. I did kill somebody. Now somebody is killing my ass. Rape on.” But if you in jail for parking tickets, and somebody’s fucking you in your ass, you’re like, “I should’ve moved that car.” -[laughter] -[scattered claps] “What was I thinking? I thought it was Good Friday. They keep moving Easter.”\\nTrying to find God before God finds me. You know, lotta religion in the news, man. You ever watch the news, they’re always talking about religious extremists. We’re at war with extremists. Extremists. What is a religious extremist? A religious extremist is a person that extremely believes in God. You think you believe in God. No, they extremely… believe in God. Like, “God coming back on Wednesday. At 2:30, I got tickets. Fantasia',\n",
       "  ' is opening for him. I hear Charlie Wilson might stop by.”\\nThat’s right. Religious extremists extremely believe in God. And occasionally blow shit up. Which is really odd when you think about it. ‘Cause if you truly believe in God, you believe that God created the Earth, the moon, the stars, the sun. You believe that God is the most powerful being in the universe. So, if you believe God’s the most powerful being in the universe, why would he need your help? What is that shit? And… It… I’m sorry.\\n[applause]\\nHelping God? And it’s never nobody smart helping God out. It’s never Malcolm Gladwell or Neil deGrasse Tyson. It’s always some motherfucker that was working at Circuit City two weeks ago. It’s like, “What the fuck? Wasn’t you loading trucks two weeks ago? Now you’re helping out God? That is some promotion.”\\nWhat the fuck is going on? I mean, here’s the thing. I think… the act of helping God is sacrilegious. If you think you can help God out, you don’t believe in God. If you really had faith you’d really have faith. I mean, check this out. I haven’t been to church in ten years. Now that’s believing in God. [laugher and applause] Shit, you go every week ’cause you don’t trust God.\\nNah, man. But I love religion. I love watching religion, studying religion. The cool thing about religion is, like, no matter who you pray to, no matter what you study, every religion… follows one basic premise. One basic idea that every religion follows. And that… And that premise is, God doesn’t make mistakes. Every religion believes that. Every one. “God, does not make… mistakes. I said, God… does not [high-pitched] make… mistakes. Ok, God don’t make no mistakes? That’s– That’s… Ok. That’s… That’s a pretty ambitious thing to say. No mistakes? You ever read the Bible? What does the Bible say happened on the seventh day? God rested. Ok, seems odd that a perfect being would rest. Let me ask you a question. Have you ever been performing a task? It was going perfect, and you took a rest? Has that ever happened in your life? No, that has never fucking happened to you. What has happened to you was you were performing a task, you fucked up, and you thought, “Let me rest… before I fuck this up some more.”\\n[laughter and applause]\\nGod doesn’t make mistakes. Hush your mouth. God make plenty of mistakes. You ever see a porcupine? Can’t eat it. Can’t hug it. It’s ugly, sticky, shitting all over the place. Mistake. What about quicksand? Sand you can drown in. You can drown dry. You think God meant to make quicksand? Mistake. You ever been to Mississippi? Mistake. M-I-S-S-T-A-K-E! You fucking kidding me? Just a big hunk of racist dirt. Fucking Mississippi. I was there a couple of months ago. I couldn’t even tell what year it was. That’s how fucked up and ghetto that shit was. Like, God damn. You know what Mississippi’s like? You know, like, when you go to the Caribbean? You know when you go to the Caribbean, you land and you get in that van? That drive. That scary-ass drive… from the airport to the resort. And you’re looking out the window, you’re like, “What the fuck? What the fuck is that shit? Oh, my God! Whoa!” You see little kids eating dreadlocks. You see Shabba Ranks stabbing a dog. Shabba. Shabba. Shabba. Shabba. See, people looking like they never saw a car before. Wheel. Wheel. Then you get to the resort and you’re like, “Jamaica’s nice.” “It’s so nice. We should invite your mother.” Shit. They give you one piña colada… and you forgive the worst poverty you’ve ever seen. You take one sip, you’re like… “That baby wasn’t really dead, right?” “I can’t wait to jet ski.”\\nTrying to find God before God finds me. Trying to get my life together, man. I had a crazy… Last few years have been crazy for me, man. Uh… [mutters] You know. Taking care of my kids, man. I got divorced. Divorced. No, no. Don’t…\\n[sparse claps]\\nNo. Don’t clap for that shit unless you’re a lawyer. You don’t wanna get divorced. Let me tell you right now. I’m talking– I’m talking from hell. You don’t want this shit. Telling you right. If you got somebody you love, hold tight. That’s right. Hold fucking tight. Commit. Don’t be the one that’s always threatening to leave, too. That’s right. Love hard or get the fuck out. If you’re gonna leav',\n",
       "  'e, leave right now. That’s right. At the show. Right now. That’s right. Just break up. We got break up booths in the back. That’s right. But before you leave, you better make sure you got some options. Some of ya’ll been in relationships so long, you don’t know how ugly you are. That’s right. Love hard or get the fuck out. Ok. You hear me? I’m telling you right now. If you’re in a relationship, all you should be doing is fucking and going places. That’s all you should be doing. Having sex and traveling. Fucking and going places. You should be coming and going. That’s all you should be doing. Ok? People say, “Oh, relationships are tough.” No, they not. They’re only tough when one person’s working on it. That’s right. Two people could move a couch real easy. One person can’t move it at all. That’s right.\\nIf you in a relationship, let me try to help you right now, ok? I’m trying to fucking help you, ok? Ok, first rule. Rule one. Stop competing. It’s not a fucking competition. That’s right. Her success is your success and your success is her success. Stop competing. Stop it, ok? Number two. Number two, ok? There is no equality in a relationship. It’s like, “We equals.” No, you’re not. You’re both there to serve. You’re in the service industry, ok? That’s right. When you’re in a relationship, you’re in a band. You’re in a fucking band. And when you’re in a band, you have roles that you play in the band. Sometimes you sing lead and sometimes you’re on tambourine. And if you’re on tambourine, play it right. Play it right. Play it with a fucking smile. ‘Cause nobody wants to see a mad tambourine player. That’s right. If you’re gonna play tambourine, you play that motherfucker right. You play it with your ass, like…\\n♪ Tambourine, motherfucker Tambourine ♪\\n♪ Tambourine, motherfucker Tambourine ♪\\n♪ Tambourine, motherfucker Tambourine ♪\\n♪ Tambourine, motherfucker Tambourine ♪\\nPlay it like Tina Turner. That’s right. You in a band. It’s like Hall and Oates. I don’t know what Oates does. But Hall never had a hit record without him.\\nYeah, you wanna stay together. How do you stay together? You gotta fuck. It’s that simple. You gots to fuck. People are like, “When we got together, it was so much fun, but then problems arose.” No they didn’t. Nothing arose. Every problem you have today, you had when you met. But you were fucking so you forgave. That’s right. You knew he didn’t do dishes. But he gave you good dick. That was a swell trade. Dick for dishes. You used to love washing them dick dishes. You knew she couldn’t cook. But she licked your balls. You’re like, “Ah, keep licking. We’ll order in.” You gots to fuck. You gotta fuck. You gotta keep it up. And you gotta fuck no matter what mood you’re in. You gotta keep the shit moving. You can’t wait for the Holy Ghost to just get you. That’s right. That’s right. Ladies, are you listening to me? Sometimes you gotta suck a melancholy\\xa0 dick. You gotta do what you gotta do. ‘Cause I can eat pussy in a horrible mood. “I can’t believe there’s no gas in the car.” “Can’t believe there’s so much mold in the basement.” Shit, I eat pussy on 9/11. Where were you? [laughter] No, man. You gots to fuck, man.\\nDude, I was married for 16 years. Married for 16 years. Yeah. That’s a long run. Hamilton won’t last that long. I was married for 16 years in the era of the cellphone. Which means my 16 years, is actually longer than my parents’ 40. That’s right. In 16 years, I had more contact with my ex-wife than my parents did in 40 years. Ok? My father used to leave for work at 6:30 in the morning and come home at 8:30 at night. And during the day, him and my mother had absolutely no contact at all. None. Ok? That’s what a relationship used to be. The kids could’ve been dead. And he wouldn’t have found that shit out till he got home. He’d be like, “Baby, the kids are dead.” “What time they die?” “About eight hours ago.” “Damn, I missed it.” Yes, that’s right. You know what else? They actually missed each other. They missed each other. You know you can’t miss nobody in 2017. Not really. You can say it. But you don’t really miss a motherfucker. ‘Cause you with them all the time. They in your fucking pocket. Soon as you leave, man. Soon as you go somewhere, you get a',\n",
       "  ' fucking text. You get a ping. You get a beep. You get a fucking Facebook, an Instagram, you get something. You know, a FaceTime. And then later on your woman goes, “You act like you don’t wanna talk.” Like, “What the fuck are you talking about? I know everything you did today. And I know how people felt about it. I gave you five likes, bitch. I gave you three smiley faces and an eggplant.”\\nDude, I was not, like, a good husband. I’ll just… I was fucked up. You know? I was addicted to porn. I know, billion-dollar industry. Just me. Right? I was addicted to porn. You know. And, you know. You know. I was 15 minutes late, everywhere. I got some witnesses. When you watch too much porn, you know what happens? Here’s what happens to you. You become, like, sexually autistic. You develop, like, sexual autism. You have a hard time with eye contact and… verbal cues. You want everything to be routine. Like, you can’t choke your woman every night. You gotta mix it up. Choke-out Thursdays. And, what happens, too, you watch too much porn, you get desensitized. You know? It’s like, when you start watching porn, it’s like, any porn will do. It’s like, “Ah, they’re naked! Ooh-hoo!” Then later on, now you’re all fucked up. And you need a perfect porn cocktail… to get you off, no? I was so fucked up. Like, I’d need an Asian girl, with a black girl’s ass… that speaks Spanish. Just to get my dick to move an inch.\\nI’m a lot better now. Ladies… that’s right, take care of your man. Fellas, take care of your wives, your girlfriends. Take care of her. Or she will leave you. She will leave you either physically or mentally. A woman can leave you mentally. That’s right, like Star Trek. Just telepath out this motherfucker. There’s guys that think they with they wife right now. But no, n i g g a, she left you months ago. She just came ’cause you got tickets. She ain’t with you. She with me.\\nOh, man, the older you get, the more shit you learn. One thing… the gangster-est shit in the world. You learn nothing more gangster, nothing smarter, nothing more powerful than a housewife. Housewives are the smartest motherfuckers on Earth. People think it’s the working woman. No. Suckers work. That’s right. Smart people find other people to work for them. That’s right. That’s right. They got the Housewives of Atlanta. They don’t got the working bitches of Atlanta. Nobody would watch that show. No, a housewife’s a bad motherfucker, boy. ‘Cause the housewife has convinced the husband… that it’s his house, too. There’s a lot of guys in here right now, think they own a house. Think it’s they house too. No. She took that house years ago. And the kids were in on it. That’s right. That’s right, the housewife’s a bad motherfucker. ‘Cause the housewife got a little time. That’s right. So, before Daddy come home, the housewife get the kids together and they rehearse a little play… that they do when Daddy get home. It’s like, “Ok, Daddy gonna be here in five minutes. You know your lines?” “I miss you, Daddy.” “Good. Good. You say that soon as he walk in, ok? I need you to grab his leg and don’t let go. I’m gonna give him a big piece of chicken. And when he fall asleep, we go back to having our house.”\\nHa-ha! That’s right, fellas. You don’t own a house. If you live with a woman, you don’t have a house. That is her fucking house. Only man that owns anything is a single man, ok? And fellas, here’s the test, right now. If you really think… you own a house, this the test. Ok, fellas, tonight when you go home, I want you to try…. I want you to try…. Fellas, when you go home tonight, I want you to try… to hang up a picture of your mother. It’s your house, right? Give it a shot. “What’s that?” “It’s a picture of my mother.” [tsks] “I don’t like that frame.” You’ll never see that picture again. Maybe at your mother’s funeral. She’ll go, “Look what I found.” Motherfucker.\\nYo, ladies, if you got a good husband, got a good man, hold on tight. Another woman will take your husband. They’ll take him. There’s women in here right now with stolen husbands. You know who you are. You’re like, “That bitch was slipping.” That’s right. Hold tight or another woman will take your man. Fellas, you don’t gotta really worry about that. Nobody’s taking',\n",
       "  ' your wife. Oh, don’t get me wrong. They’ll fuck your wife. Oh, they’ll fuck her good. They’ll fuck her better than you. But they not gonna take her. There’s no guy going, “Yeah, I want her to yell at me the way she yells at him.” “I wanna live in a house with no pictures of my mother.” Oh, they’ll fuck her, and then they’ll return her. “I believe this is yours.” “Bitch had me feeling bad about myself.”\\nOh, man. I fucked up, man. Divorce, man. You don’t want no parts of this shit, man. And… you know, it’s… It’s my fault ’cause I’m a fucking asshole, man. I’m just… I… I wasn’t… I wasn’t a good husband. I wasn’t a good husband. I didn’t listen. I wasn’t kind. True. True. You know? You know, I had an attitude. I thought, “Ah, I pay for everything. I could do what I want.” That shit don’t fucking work. You know, I just thought I was the shit, man. Uh, I didn’t play the tambourine. You gotta play the tambourine. Everybody gotta play the tambourine. I cheated. Yeah. I’m serious. I’m not bragging. I cheated. I was, like, on the road. You know, I end up sleeping with three different women. It’s, like, fucked up. You know what’s fucked up? Here’s the thing. When guys cheat… it’s like, we want something new. We want something new, right? But, then, you know what happens? Your woman finds out. And now she’s new. She’s never the same again. So, now you got new, but you got a bad new. You know? You got bad fucking new, man. And I know every woman in here’s like, “Fuck you, Chris. What the fuck, man? You? I thought you was alright. You? Come on, Chris. What the fuck is wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with men?” I know a bunch of women are thinking that right now. Every woman in here’s like, “Fuck you, Chris.” And every guy in here right now is going, “Three?” [laughter] “That’s it? Just three? God damn, n i g g a. I work at UPS. I got more hoes than that. Three? You must’ve really loved your wife. You a romantic.”\\nYo, you don’t wanna get divorced, man. This shit is no joke, man. Had to go through a custody fight for my kids. Just to see my kids, man. That shit’s fucked up, man. First of all, you don’t wanna be a man in family court. And you don’t wanna be a black man in any court. Ok, even the black judge comes to work with his lawyer. And he keeps his robe on all day. And writes “Judge” on the back. Just in case somebody thinks it’s a n i g g a with a cape. “Is that a n i g g a with a cape?” “Nope, just a judge.” Yo, man, I was in court. That shit was scary, man. Like, to not know if you’re gonna be able to fucking see your kids. You know? And when I got divorced, I wanted it to be smooth, you know? So, I bought a house around the corner. Ok? Like a fucking quarter of a mile. Like, right around the fucking corner. Damn near the same house, ok? But, it wasn’t enough, man. I went in there and that judge was like, “Uh, Mr. Rock, I need to see pictures… of the beds in the bedroom to make sure the children have a place to sleep.” I was like, “What… What… You think I got a manger? What? Like, I got a million-dollar house with no beds?” Ok, showed him the picture, right? But that wasn’t enough. Then the judge was like, “Uh, Mr. Rock, I need to see pictures of the refrigerator and the food inside… to make sure the children have enough to eat.” And I’m like… “What have you heard about me?” [laughter] “I’m Chris Rock, not Chris Brown.”\\nYo, man. Yo, fellas, I hope none of you get divorced. I’m telling you right now, if you ever do anything good for your kids, take a picture of that shit. If you hug them, take a picture. If you feed them, take a picture. ‘Cause you never know when you might need receipts of love. Winter is coming. It worked out. I got my kids. I got my kids. I got my custody. It’s fucking beautiful, ok? Got my kids, man. I just won them this afternoon. I got my fucking kids, man. That shit was, like, humiliating, man. Trying to… prove your parenthood, man. So, I know I said you’re not supposed to compete in a relationship. But, after you go through that shit, like, “Am I gonna lose my kids? It’s like, “Yo, I’m going hard, every time I have my kids.” And I always went hard, but I’m going extra hard. “I don’t know what you’re doing at your mother’s house, but we gonna top t',\n",
       "  'hat shit.” Every motherfucking time, ok? Sometimes I bring guest stars. I make sure they go back to her with a story. They like, “Mama, Mama, Drake helped me with my homework.” “Lady Gaga made me a grilled cheese sandwich.” Ya’ll think I’m bullshitting. Check my Instagram, alright?\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd the crazy thing is… So, after you get through the custody thing, then you gotta divide the money. That’s some fucking scary shit, man. And whoever, whoever… makes the most money has to pay the legal fees for the other person. So, I had to pay for a lawyer to divorce me. That’s like hiring a hit man to kill you. It’s like, “Ok, here’s a picture of me. I’m gonna be at Burger King… at 10:38, ok? Shoot me in the head and give me a call.” So.. I’m in court. Yo, one day I’m in court and I’m just looking around. And, you know, she got three lawyers. I got three lawyers. Shit’s expensive as fuck. She got three lawyers. I got three lawyers. The judge. The bailiff. The stenographer. And I’m looking at all these motherfuckers, man. I was like, “Wow, look at this whole town.” Just here. And I’m looking at all these people and realize, like, everybody in this room is far more educated than me. Everybody. I dropped out of Boys High, ok. Got college motherfuckers coming at me, right? And I realize everybody in the room, born to much better circumstances than me. I’m from Bed-motherfucking-Stuy, baby. And everybody in there is there to take my money. [laughter] It’s like, “Everybody in here is gonna leave with more money except me.” And they got up that morning. They brushed they teeth. They put on suits. They fixed their hair with the sole purpose of taking my shit. And, at that moment, I realized something. I made it. I made it. Started from the bottom, now I’m here. I made it, man. And after that, I was like, “Fuck it, take it. Whatever you need. Take it. I’ll be alright. I’m gonna work. It’s gonna be good.”\\n‘Cause here’s the crazy thing. Some of these lessons, you just gotta learn. Like, I brought this shit on myself. You know? Nobody told me to go ho up, you know. I brought this shit on myself. And, you just gotta learn some lessons. Some man lessons. Ok? I know it’s hard being a woman, but there’s a coldness… that you have to accept… when you’re a man, especially a black man. It’s like… The worlds cold as a motherfucker, ok? When you get older, one thing I learned… only women, children and dogs… are loved unconditionally. Women, children, and dogs are loved unconditionally. A man is only loved… under the condition that he provides something. Ok? I’ve never heard a woman in my life say, “You know, after he got laid off, we got so much closer.” No, no, no. I once heard my grandmother say, “A broke man is like a broke hand. Can’t do nothing with it.” What kind of gangster shit is that? That’s right. Women, children, and dogs are loved unconditionally. A man is only loved under the condition that he provides something. That’s right, fellas, when you meet a new girl, what do your friends ask you? “What’s she look like?” Ladies, when you meet a new guy, what do your friends ask you? “What does he do?” “What the fuck does that n i g g a do that can help you out? Can this motherfucker facilitate a dream or not? Even right now, Michelle Obama is looking at Barack, going, “What’s your plans, n i g g a?” “How’s that book turning out? I need to see some pages.” I\\nremember, right when my divorce was final, I was at a party and I saw Rihanna. I was like, “Ok, let’s start this again.” So, I’m at this party, I see Rihanna. I was like, “Ok, let me say whats up.” Right? And I’m like, “How you doing, Rihanna?” You ever forget how old you are? Rihanna looked at me like I was one of her aunts. Like… She didn’t even register me as a dick-carrying member of society. Like, I would have had an easier time fucking Aretha Franklin.\\nAh, man. I’m retired. I am, uh… This cheat shit. I’m done. I’m done. You get to a certain age. You go, you lost… Shit. You lose enough shit. It’s like, “Fuck this.” I am done cheating. I’m… Hey, I love pussy, but I like peace more. Peace is better than pussy. Peace makes my dick hard. I need motherfucking peace, motherfucker. You wanna be my girl? Be peaceful. Just some peace, motherfucker. That',\n",
       "  '’s right, I ain’t cheating at all, you know. I mean, unless Rihanna, you know…\\nIt’s all good, man. Now I’m dating. I’m actually dating. It’s just weird, man. It’s weird. I was married for a long time, man. You know, I date some girls my age. And some a little younger. That shit is crazy, man. Yo, shit has changed. These girls fuck fast now. They fuck fast and they leave. They just get the fuck out yo house. They just fuck and leave. I’m like, “Where you going? It’s yo place.” And they fuck immediately. I’m a grown man. And I’m like, “This is inappropriate.” My God. Young girls like to get on top. Always wanna get on top. “Let me ride it, Daddy. Let me get on top. Let me ride it. Let me get on top. Let me ride it. Let me ride it. Let me ride it.” You can’t get no 45 year-old-woman to get on top. She’s like, “N i g g a, you lucky I’m laying like this.” “I’ll turn over to help you finish, but that’s about it. These knees are delicate.” Shit, I’m on Tinder right now, under my own name. My friends are like, “You can’t be under your own name. What if you find a woman that just wants you ’cause you’re Chris Rock?” I’m like, “But I am Chris Rock. What should I put? ‘Cedric the Entertainer’?” Shit, my profile picture on Tinder right now is me, butt-naked, holding a microphone, and a tambourine. Hey, I’m out of here. Ya’ll take care.

Thank you very much! Thank you all. Oh, wow. That was exciting, wasn’t it? Thank you, guys. Have a seat, feel comfortable, relax. I want to thank everyone in LA for a wonderful week. It’s been great here. You know what? It’s been ten years since the last time I played Los Angeles, if you can imagine. I know! I know, I’ve been gone for a very long time. And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years. I’m not gonna take you through all the agony I’ve been through, but it was tough. Some of it you might’ve seen.\\nI don’t know if you ever saw on TMZ the big headline: “Dave Chappelle Drunk Onstage in Detroit.” Well, if you saw it, I wasn’t drunk. I had smoked some reefer… with some rappers. Yeah. I don’t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong, stronger than I what I was accustomed to. The article goes on to say I was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. I was booed. I did not leave. It was a long bomb. It was a fucking nightmare. Two puffs of weed, that’s all it was. Two puffs. I never had that happen, where I take two puffs of weed, I looked at the guy next to me, I was like, “I’m gonna bomb, n i g g a. I can feel it.” And that guy called my name. “Dave Chappelle!” N i g g a s was like… Normally, when you do a comedy show– you guys don’t know what it looks like up here, but n i g g a s be just looking up at you like… That’s how the show started. Didn’t take long for their faces to switch up like, “What the fuck?” They started looking amongst themselves. So I knew I wasn’t doing good. I don’t remember what I was saying. It just took one person to break the ice. It was a black lady with a Ford Motor shirt on. Stood up suddenly. “Fuck you, Dave Chappelle!” I said, “Excuse me?” She said, “I worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!” And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. “Yeah!” The whole crowd banded together and started chanting, “We want our money back! We want our money back!” I said, “Oh, shit.” I snapped out of it. “Good people of Detroit, hear me. Hear me now. You will never get your fucking money back.” Fuck that. I said, “I’m like Evel Knievel. I get paid for the attempt. I didn’t promise this shit would be good.” “Boo!” They said, “Fuck you!”\\nThis went on for a long time. And then, after the show, I felt so bad, I took half of the money from the show– thousands of dollars– I said, “I’m gonna give this to charity.” You know what I did? I bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around Detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. I was very mad at Detroit that night. Because not only did I bomb, I had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. Fucking nightmare.\\nThat would be like if you were having sex with a woman and, for some reason– this would never happen– but for some reason, she had a mousetrap in her pussy. You get caught in the trap. And then you’ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night. I’d still do it, but I’d be careful the next time. The old mousetrap-in-the-pussy trick, eh? Fool me once. Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough time. And I wanted to give up sometimes. I almost did give up, but then, right before I gave up, I decided not to. But I made the call. They answered the phone. “Hello? Dancing with the Stars.” I said, “Not yet. Not yet.” Yeah. If you see me on that shit, it’s over. Trust me. My spirit is broken. If yo',\n",
       "  'u see me waiting for them judges… getting critiqued on my cha-cha, fuck that.\\nI’ve been hanging out in– I haven’t been working in LA, but I come out here and hang out and shit. I was out here a few weeks ago. I almost got arrested. I’m not bullshitting. This happens to a lot of black people. What happened was… I was coming out of one of those nightclubs in Hollywood, and my friend saw me. I guess I was wobbling or something. So, he just rolled up. He’s a good friend of mine. He’s like, “Hey, Dave, give me the keys.” I was like, “All right, n i g g a, just take the keys.” And I got in the passenger’s side of my car, and he drove it. It was fine. Just talking, chopping it up. And then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us. Now, I should tell you, the friend that was driving me was black, which really doesn’t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. Not my fear. I’m black, but I’m also Dave Chappelle. So, I figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. Traffic stop started off on the right foot. The cops came up to the driver’s side. “Hi. How are you guys doing tonight?” And he recognized me immediately. “Oh. Dave Chappelle.” And I looked at my friend like, “We’re getting out of this shit.” And then he says, “You guys were swerving in the lane. Do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second?” Still no cause for alarm. I looked through the rearview mirror. The body language of the arrest looked good. Just talking. So, then I started fucking with the radio. You know a traffic stop is going good if you’re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. But then, when I looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. That motherfucker was back there like… And the next thing I knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and I thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: “Oh, my God. What is gonna happen to me?” And the police walked up to the window. “Mr. Chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. He refused to take our breathalyzer test.” I said, “That motherfucker. Not complying? That’s odd. So, officer, what’s gonna happen to me?” “You’re fine. We’re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and we’ll arrange for you to have a ride home.” I said, “Oh, well, no. I would rather you just give me the keys.” He said, “Mr. Chappelle, your friend already told us he’s your designated driver. We can’t let you drive in this condition.” I was like, “No, n i g g a, I’m good.” And then suddenly, the shit turned into Vegas. He was like… “I’ll let you blow for it.” I said, “Excuse me?” He said, “If you blow in my breathalyzer–” I said, “Oh, n i g g a, I thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. What’s the– Whew! Whew!” “If you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, I’ll give you the keys to the car.” I said, “Uh… set ’em up, n i g g a. Let’s play.” And I blew in that thing. And it made a noise. “Beep!” I said, “Uh-oh.” And he looked at it. He said, “Oh, well, Mr. Chappelle, I guess you’re free to go.” I said, “I am?” I didn’t know that thing didn’t pick up weed. I drove home on the miles an hour. Yeah, it all worked out. It all worked out. I’m one of the lucky ones.\\nIt doesn’t work out that well for everybody. I saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in LA in traffic. You see that shit on rush hour traffic? They beat a black woman’s ass. This woman didn’t even do anything wrong. It’s fucked up. It was so fucked up, it didn’t even go to court. The City of L.A. just gave that woman $1.5 million for her pain and suffering. That is not bad, considering that’s the same amount of money that Marcos Maidana made to fight Floyd Mayweather the second time. And this woman obviously hasn’t trained a day in her life. You can see it on the tape. She didn’t come to fight. Her guards were low. She was taking a lot of shots.\\nEverybody’s mad at police now. I watched that– You see that shit on Netflix, Making a Murderer? The Steven Avery story. If you haven’t seen it, check it out. Steven Avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the United States has ever been in! In a justice system designed for him to thrive, he’s failed miserably twice. I can’t even wrap my mind around it. If Making a Murderer was about a black dude, that shit would be called Duh! Of course everything would go wrong. Seems like he did it, all right. The motherfucker even had $200,000 for his legal defense. That should get you off in Wisconsin. That’s like OJ money. All he needed to get off that he didn’t have was a single black juror. That’s all it would’ve took. Because only a black dude in the United States can look at other dudes and be like, “I think the police did this shit.” He’s fucked up in the game. That’s how OJ got off.\\nI’ve been watching that new OJ show. I can’t get enough of that shit. Doesn’t it bring back good memories? But I forgot just how polarizing that OJ case was. And you know, I’ve met OJ Simpson on four different occasions in my life. And before the end of the show, I will tell you about each of those occasions. T',\n",
       "  'he first time I met OJ Simpson, I was in Santa Monica. -Santa Monica! -Yeah! I can’t believe a black dude was like, “Santa Monica!” You the last n i g g a I would expect to say that. Let me see your shoes. You got some Vans on, n i g g a? What you got? “Santa Monica!” You? At the time, I was . I had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, “Hey, OJ Simpson’s here, and he said he wants to meet you.” I said, “What? Fuck yeah!” I ran down the steps, and OJ was down there. He’s like, “Hey, young man. How are you? It’s very good to meet you. And you’re doing really good work, and I hope good things happen for you in your life.” I was like, “Man, thanks, Mr. Juice.” Standing beside him, was– I don’t know the nice way to say this– his soon-to-be-slain wife. Ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you’re not gonna make it to the end of this show. Just man the fuck up. She’s dead. We already know what happened. We don’t know who did it, but we know what happened. I should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. She actually embraced me. She said, “I think you’re adorable,” and she hugged me. She goes, “Good luck to you,” and she held me for a long time. And I whispered in her ear, “Bitch, are you trying to get us both killed?” I’m just kidding. I didn’t say that, but… that was the first time, in a nutshell.\\nIt’s good to see so many… so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. Very diverse crowd. Looks like you thought Bernie Sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. But… surprise! It’s me. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I’m happy, really, to see black people come. A lot of black people don’t fuck with me like they used to. But there’s a few reasons you don’t see black people at my shows. One is because, obviously, black people have slower Internet connections. I mean, that would be my guess. I don’t know what– Actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community I hold so dear.\\nA couple of weeks ago, I was supposed to be in Flint, Michigan, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in Flint. I don’t know if you know this, but the water in Flint is fucking poisonous. It’s actually making people sick. Hollywood people are like, “So what? At least they have water.” But this water– this water is fucked up. So, a lot of black celebrities flew into Flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and I was on the schedule to appear.\\nUh… So, the reason a lot of people haven’t heard about this benefit– it was the same day as the Oscars. Right, I know. So, I was on my way to the airport to go to Flint, and then Chris Rock calls me and is like, “Hey, Dave, I got a ticket for you for the Oscars. Can you make it?” And I was like, “Sure, n i g g a. I’m on my way to the airport right now.” Come on, man. What am I gonna do about that water? What am I, a fucking superhero? I need to have fun. I need to live, too! I didn’t fuck that water up! Stevie Wonder was there. They didn’t need me. I’m sorry, everybody. I’d never been to the Oscars. You’ve seen the movies I make. I was excited.\\nI knew I was gonna get into some trouble, because when I was walking on the red carpet, the black press came after me. “Excuse me, brother.” When you hear somebody call you “brother” too much, something terrible is about to happen. “Excuse me, brother. Brother?” And I looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. I said, “Uh-oh.” He said, “I just want to ask you a couple questions.” I said, “What publication are you with?” He said, “Me? I’m with The Daily Bongo.” I said, “Daily Bongo? What the fuck? Who the fuck reads this?” He said, “Listen, brother, I just want to ask you a quick question. You understand that this year, this is a boycott for the Oscars. So, I’m just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight.” I said, “Boycott? N i g g a, I haven’t been working in ten years. What do you mean, boycott? I’ve been on strike. Y’all n i g g a s didn’t stop working. I had to watch fucking Key and Peele do my show every night! So, fuck The Daily Bongo,” is what I said. I went to the Oscars and had a wonderful time. I went in that fucking green room. It was filled with so many stars, I couldn’t even believe what I was seeing. Hollywood was seducing me all over again. I was sitting back there. I’m smoking, drinking with the stars.\\nAnd then two Hollywood movie producers came over, right to me. “Oh, my God. Dave Chappelle,” said the leader one. He was obviously gay. Some guys, you can just tell. The other one seemed like a money guy. Maybe he was from Texas or some shit. But the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. And then he hit me with: “So, David, um… do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue?” The truth is, I don’t. But if you know the game, you’re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don’t have ideas. I was like, “Yeah, man. I got plenty of ideas.” And he called my bluff. “Really? Like what?” “Huh? Oh. Um… um…”\\nAnd then I just started making up shit that I thought m',\n",
       "  'aybe he’d like to see. I said, “I have a superhero idea.” He goes, “Really?” I go, “Yeah. He’s a– He’s a gay superhero.” He was like, “Really?! What’s it called?” “Huh? Oh, it’s called– It’s called Same Hero, New Boots. It’s about a gay sous-chef in San Francisco… that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he’s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. And he starts saving everybody in San Francisco. But at first, he only saves gay people. Later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. The only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them.” “Well, I don’t understand. Why wouldn’t they remember him?” I said, “Because, dummy, he’s gay. He keeps changing his outfit. People come up– ‘Thanks for saving me, sir. What’s your name anyway?’ He’s like, ‘Same Hero, New Boots!’ And that motherfucker flies away.”\\nHe was like, “I like it a lot.” The Texan didn’t like that shit at all. He was upset. “That’s impossible, a gay superhero.” I said, “What? Well, I have others. I have a superhero you’d love, ’cause he’s stronger than Superman and he fights for truth, justice and the American way, like Superman, but more than Superman. He beats up Mexicans for no reason.” The Texan’s like, “You got my attention.” I’m like, “Man, this motherfucker’s so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. Only problem with this guy is he can’t even activate his powers unless he touches– unless he touches a woman’s vagina. Not a long touch, just a couple of pats.” He said, “Well, what’s the problem with that?” I said, “The problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. And he’s often short on cash. So, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. ‘Please, miss! That building’s on fire. Can I pat your vagina? Quickly. People are dying!’ But he can’t tell them exactly why. ‘Eww! Get away! You’re gross!’ ‘Please, miss! People are dying! Just a couple of pats!’ ‘Eww! Gross! Get away!’ So, he rapes them.\\nI know, I know. That’s the dilemma for the audience. Because he rapes, but he saves a lot of lives. And he saves way more than he rapes, and he only rapes to save. But he does rape.” I didn’t realize it, but the whole green room was looking at us. All the celebrities were disgusted. “Ohh.” That guy from Texas was like, “Here’s my card. Call me on Monday.” That worked out.\\nThe second time I met OJ Simpson. It was right after the trial of the century. There I was, now a young man of probably 23. OJ Simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet Earth. I was in a restaurant in Beverly Hills with my agents. I wasn’t alone in the restaurant, but I was alone. I was the only black person in the restaurant. And in the 90’s, that felt very uncomfortable. Now I tend to enjoy it at this age. I was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but I later learned fucking sucked. And suddenly, a group of women walked by. Every race was in that group. Black, white, Asian, Latina, white, white… and white again. They were all gorgeous. I watched them walk by. Then I saw a familiar face. Al Cowlings, the man from the infamous Bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. Couldn’t believe what I saw. And then, close behind him, was OJ Simpson, newly released from jail. The restaurant fell still. I was shocked. I didn’t mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. “OJ!” He stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth. He leaned over all the white people I was having dinner with and shook my hand. “How are you, young man?” He looked in my eyes, and I could see in his eyes that he didn’t remember meeting me the first time. And then he walked away. And I looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. And the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named Sharon who used to represent me. “How could you?” she said. “How could you shake hands with that murderer?” I said, “Sharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over 11,000 yards. And he was acquitted. So, you know, fuck it. The glove didn’t fit. The glove didn’t fit. Get over yourself.” Some people can’t do that.\\nSome people just can’t get over themselves. Gay people have a hard time doing that recently. Here we go. Here comes the deep water. No, recently I’ve noticed that. I noticed it with that Manny Pacquiao controversy. Yeah, it was– Now, in the gay community’s defense, Manny Pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that I won’t repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals. It wasn’t a good look. Nike took his shoes immediately. Which I thought was a little harsh. A little harsh, you know what I mean? Just ’cause he’s Asian. You know what I mean? How the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an Asian dude to appease a gay dude? You know what I mean? No? You don’t know what I mean. Bu',\n",
       "  't Asian people kind of know what I mean. No? No Asians in the front? No? No, this is what I mean. Look, you’re an Asian dude– I say this with no disrespect.\\nWe’re all Americans, right? And we can agree that America has a huge body count all over the world, but nowhere more than Asia. Literally, if you look at history, recently, we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent. We dropped two atomic bombs on fucking Japan, and they’ve been drawing Hello Kitty and shit ever since. There’s a lot of lady-boys in the wake of our bombs. And I know these things because my wife is Asian. She’s Filipino. All right, okay. So, that explains it. Now you know why you see me at all those Filipino events. I’m not there picking up pussy. I’m dropping some off. I take my wife to all that shit. I took my wife to see Pacquiao fight Mayweather. We sat ringside, okay? That– Yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that’s what that was.\\nBut if you know what’s popping in the Philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the Philippines growing up without their mothers. Yes. A lot of women in the Philippines go to the Arabian Peninsula, they come to the United States, they make all their money here, they send all that money back home, which is still one of the number-one staples in the Philippines’ economy– money that the expats send back to the Philippines. The men, on the other hand, are left rearing children, twiddling their thumbs, waiting on their wives’ checks. These men have been fucking emasculated.\\nAnd then suddenly, a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist. This is not the guy you’re supposed to ask, “What do you think of homosexuals?” He’s not your champ. Shit. That’s why I don’t have a sneaker deal, ’cause if you say something that people don’t like, they’ll take your fucking shoes off.\\nIf Martin Luther King had a sneaker deal, we’d still be on the back of the bus. It’s true. The Nike exec would come up– “Hi, Martin. Uh… we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans. It’s upsetting our Southern distributors.” “But I don’t understand. I thought that’s why I had a sneaker deal in the first place.” “Not quite. Really, it’s a walking shoe. And we like the marching, but… Try to understand.” Fuck that shit.\\nYou know, I get it, though. I understand why gay people are mad, and I empathize. You know what? I’m just telling you this as a black dude. I support your movement. But if you want to take some advice from a Negro, pace yourself. These things take a while. Just ’cause they passed the law doesn’t mean they’re gonna like it. Brown v. Board of Education was in.\\nSomebody called me a n i g g e r in traffic last Wednesday. It takes a minute. My wife’s friend Stewart told me that. My wife has a lot of gay friends. Stewart’s their leader. She has a lot of gay friends. And I don’t like ’em. Not ’cause they’re gay. I’m just judging them on the merits of their character. They’re just not nice dudes. They’re fucking rude houseguests. They’re sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. Then I come in, and they act like the party’s over. “Hey, Stewart. What’s going on?” This guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. “Hi, David.” “Stewart, what’s all the beef, man? What’s going–” He always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. The last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words “husband and wife” out of the law. I said, “Why would you want those words out of the law?” He said, “Because it discriminates against same-sex couples.” I was like, “N i g g a s, please, save me the semantics. Just trust me. Take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. You’re about to crap out! Just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that’s the wife.” No, no. Stewart didn’t like that. Stewart educates me about this movement. I didn’t even know shit about it. He told me it’s called “LBGTQ!” I was like, “What the fuck is the ‘Q’?” Does that even make sense? “Q”? Turns out “Q” is like the vowels. That shit is sometimes “Y.” It’s for gay dudes that don’t really know they’re gay. Like prison fags who are like, “What? I’m not gay, n i g g a. I’m just sucking these dicks to pass the time. I’m not ‘G.’ I’m ‘Q.’ Ugh.” I think– Okay, again, of all those letters, the “T” has the toughest road ahead. In fact, I think the “T” should stand for “Tough road ahead.”\\nThey’ve got the longest mental gap to bridge. That’s all I’m saying. Because whenever I see one of them Ts on the street, I don’t mind them, but I’ll be like, “Man, I miss Bruce.” I’m sorry, guys. I’m 42. I remember Bruce Jenner. Before the Kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white American superhero. It was amazing. He was beating Africans at track and field. We’d never seen anything like it. He was on my cereal box growing up. You know how much of that cereal I ate? N i g g a, I didn’t know he was gonna do that. I knew before you guys knew. I heard things on the street in Hollywood. You’d just be out, see peo',\n",
       "  'ple. “Hey, what’s up, Kanye? Why the long face?” “N i g g a, you’ll see. I got two mother-in-laws now.” And when I heard he was gonna do it, I was scared. I didn’t think the public was ready. I didn’t think the media was ready. And you know what? I was wrong. Not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. I’d never seen anything like it. “Welcome to the world, Caitlyn. So long, Bruce. Hello, Caitlyn.” I was shocked! Is this happening?\\nWait a minute. Is this a time in American history where an American can make a decision for themselves, and even though other Americans don’t understand it, they’ll support it and let this person live a happy life? Is this what’s happening? If it is, then good for America. That’s Dave Chappelle, the American. Although, Dave Chappelle, the black American, he was a little jealous. I was like, “How the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination Olympics?” If the police shot half as many transgenders as they did n i g g a s last year, there’d be a fucking war in LA. I know black dudes in Brooklyn– hard street motherfuckers– that wear high heels just to feel safe. Transgenders are gangsters. I used to do business with a transgender in Hollywood. Man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. She’d walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. Wouldn’t say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. Then she’d walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. “Let’s talk business, gentlemen.” “Aaah!” Shit is scary as fuck. If your best friend pitched that to you, you’d be horrified. “Yo, n i g g a, let’s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits.” “What?! Can’t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? You sure that’s what you want to do?” “There’s only way to find out, n i g g a. Wu-Tang! Pow! Pow! Let’s go to the club and trick n i g g a s into fucking us. Yeah.”\\nThe third time I met OJ Simpson— The third time I met OJ Simpson, I was doing great in life. I’d just finished the second season of Chappelle’s Show. Man, those were good days. I was playing a comedy club in Miami, The Improv. I don’t know if you’ve ever been, but if you have, you’d know the door for the green room is right on the stage. Can you imagine such a thing? If I walked out of the door of the green room, bam, I was right here, right from the dressing room. And I did that. I walked out, and the whole crowd was like, “Hooray!” And I looked– ma’am, as close as you are to me– I saw him as soon as I came out: The Juice. And I saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who I was. I didn’t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and I didn’t want to start a panic. But I did my show. The show went great. I said, “Good night, everyone.” They all said, “Yay!” And I didn’t say nothing to OJ, but I just gave him the signal to let him know I knew he was there. And I walked into the green room, and OJ was already in there! I was like, “How the fuck is this possible?” I was scared. And then my friends came in, and we all started talking. We sat down on the couch. And I’m just telling you what I saw with my own eyes. You can believe me or not believe me. But in my experience, OJ Simpson– one of the nicest men I’d ever met. He was nice to me. He was nice to my friends. The conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. We talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the Juice said, “You know what? I’ve got to be going. But it’s good to see you again, and I’m glad things went so well.” I said, “Thanks, Juice.” And my friends said, “Yeah, goodbye, Mr. Juice.” They were new to the game. He said, “No. Thank you… for your hospitality. Good night, guys.“ And we said, “Good night.” And he just walked out of the room. And as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, “That n i g g a did that shit. Did you feel that? I could feel like… murder in the room.”\\nWell, you young heads missed that shit. You’re all too young. You don’t remember that. -How old are you, young, man? You. -Twenty-four. Twenty-four? You don’t know shit. You don’t know shit! You gotta Google shit that I lived through. See, this is why I lock motherfuckers’ phones up. Seriously. Because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that– We all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. You know, I’m from a different time, young man. A dark time to you. I’m from a time that I didn’t even used to know who was on the phone until I answered the shit. Like, when tragedy used to strike.\\nI remember I was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom. You remember these days? And she turned it on to one of three channels. And she said, “Class, the space shuttle is taking off, and we’re all gonna watch it take off.” Man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. That’s right. You remember. It fucking exploded! Right on television. Everybody on board, dead. Immediately presumed',\n",
       "  ' dead. It was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like… “You can go home.” It was a goddamn national tragedy. This was Cold War America. The Russians were laughing at us.\\nMy point is, for a guy your age wouldn’t even know the pain, because in your generation, it’s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. How can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? I’m getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. I’m crying about Paris, and then Brussels happens. I can’t keep track of all this shit. So you just give the fuck up. That’s the hallmark of your generation, and that’s fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. This is the age of spin. The age where nobody knows what the fuck they’re even looking at. Did you know that Planned Parenthood was for abortions? It’s for people that don’t plan things out at all. That’s right. So, a guy your age doesn’t really know how he feels. Are you pro-choice? Are you anti-consequences? What does it all really mean? It’s easier not to care for you. But for us, we were trained to care. We were raised that way.\\nI used to watch a fucking cartoon when I was growing up called Care Bears. It was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. They were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. They cared about each other and everything else. They all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. Very, very loving group of beings. And when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didn’t get mean faces. They got determined. Hmm! And the leader would say, “Come on, guys. It’s time for the Care Bear Stare!” Remember that shit? And them little teddy bears would lock arms… and stare at the problem– and I’m not even bullshitting– actual love would shoot out of their chests… and would dispel anything that was fucked up. And when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. And then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasn’t gonna let us do that and that it’s impossible to shoot love out of your chest.\\nHowever, I have shot love onto somebody’s chest before. I do it all the time. It’s the next best thing. You kids don’t know. Your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. Everybody’s mad. Back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. Now everybody’s just trying to get in on the act. I try to think to myself, “When did everyone get mad?” And then I realize this happened before we were born. This is a long way to go, but… it probably started in the Second World War. Think about it. All these black men, millions of black men, leave the United States for the first time, go over to Europe with America’s Armed Forces and fight the Nazis and make more money fighting Nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the United States. And a lot of those men, while they were in Europe– just to be real, not to be crass– a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. I’m sorry, ladies and gentlemen. This was World War II Europe, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. And it’s very hard to come back to America and sit on the back of the bus after you’ve been in the South of France, getting your dick sucked for a Crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. That’s a life-changing experience. And while that was happening in Europe, here in America, for the first time, women entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. All the men were gone. Someone had to run the factory. The ladies did it. That’s right. This was the first generation of American women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women weren’t the same. American women had grown. They were uttering phrases that no woman on Earth had ever spoken before, things like, “No” and “Shut the fuck up” and “I don’t feel like it.”\\nAnd then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the American public. They fucked up. They tested it for 12 years. They didn’t realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. They were mind-expanding. It was LSD and mescaline and shit like that. And for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in. By 1960, the President of the United States was only 42 years old. Can you imagine? DMX is older than that. And he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. He was gonna avoid the Cold War. He was gonna end segregation. And they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in Dallas. This country was never the same. There were seven more major assassinations in the ’60s. Anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. Kennedy, Kennedy, King, X, Evers, on and on. You didn’t even have to be famous. You could be a ',\n",
       "  'college student at Kent State, or in Mississippi, protesting the Vietnam War, and they shot them, too.\\nThe ’70s were a wild era. And while all this was going on… Bill Cosby raped 54 people. Holy shit. That’s a lot of rapes, man. This guy’s putting up real numbers. He’s like the Steph Curry of rape. Man, that’s a lot of rapes. Fifty-four? If he had raped less people… that’s still two dozen rapes! Don’t forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. Ladies and gentlemen, that’s over hours of rape. It only takes hours to get a pilot’s license. If rapes were aircrafts, this n i g g a is Top Gun for sure.\\nYeah, that’s a tough one. And I was onstage not too long ago. I was in Syracuse, New York. Yeah. Well, yeah, for Syracuse. But the show didn’t go so good… all because I was talking about Bill Cosby a little bit. Not a little bit. I’ll be honest. I talked about him for like, minutes. And a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, “You are a fucking asshole for saying these things!” “I know.” Instantly, I felt bad. Not bad about what I was saying. I just felt bad like, “Oh, that’s too bad she doesn’t like the show.” I didn’t realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. By the time I saw her, I just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. I was horrified. I said, “Oh, my God! I’m gonna kick this bitch in the face.” Lucky for me, I didn’t have to. Security tackled her. But it was a really fucking horrifying scene. A scuffle ensued. And then, finally, she screamed out to me, “Women suffer!” I said, “I know.” And, ladies, I need you to know… that I know. I need you to know. Seriously, there’s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. I would include myself in that. Don’t ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. There’s a lot of men like that in this room. There’s a lot of men like that in the world. Or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass n i g g a s. But as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, I started to take offense. And I’ll be honest, race was involved. She was a young white woman. Well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. “Bitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?” She didn’t get it. She just kept going. “Women suffer!” “I know.” “Women suffer!” “Same team.” “Women suffer!” “I know.” And this is when she went too far: “We suffer just like you.” “Slow your roll, bitch. You suffer, yes, but not like me. Not like us.” She goes, “Suffering is suffering. What’s the difference?” I said, “Come on, white woman, you know what it is. You was in on the heist. You just don’t like your cut.” You suffer, I suffer. You suffer, I suffer. That’s how it works.\\nCan’t do comparative suffering. If you’re hungry, and your friend says, “You know, people are starving in Africa,” “So what, n i g g a? I still want lunch.” Black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it’s a fucking dead-end game. Blacks and Jews do that shit to each other all the time. You ever played Who Suffered More with a Jewish person? It’s a tough game. Whenever you think you’ve got the Jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, “Well, don’t forget about Egypt.” “Egypt?! God damn, n i g g a, I didn’t know we was going all the way back to Egypt.” What the fuck is wrong with her? What does she think? Does she think that I don’t know that rape is wrong? Does she think that maybe I don’t have empathy for Bill Cosby’s alleged victims? And I would be remiss if I didn’t remind you that technically these are all still allegations. Although, I admit it looks very bad. Perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a 42-year-old black comedian.\\nObviously, Bill Cosby was a hero to me. And she doesn’t know what it feels like to think that your hero might’ve done something so heinous, my God, you can’t imagine. It’d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself… had raped 54 people. You’d say to yourself, “Oh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream. I don’t want it to rape.” Didn’t want to believe it. At first, I didn’t believe it. I said, “These people are obviously trying to destroy Dr. Cosby’s rich legacy.” Even 34 allegations into it, I was still like, “Man… he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people.” I know, I know. But it’s really tough.\\nYou guys are young. Imagine if you found out 40 years from now that Kevin Hart raped 54 people. You’d be like, “Oh, my God.” The only one that would believe that would be Katt Williams. He’d be like, “I knew that motherfucker was up to something! I knew Kevin had raped those people.” You know, I was mad at Kevin, too, though. You know why? Okay, first of all, I didn’t even know Kevin was as successful as he was. I found that shit out the hard way. I was at home when my son busted in. He said, “Dad, I need $250.” He’s only years old, so I freaked out. “What’s going on, n i g g a?',\n",
       "  ' Is somebody trying to kill you?” He said, “No, no. Kevin Hart’s coming to town, and I wanted to see his show.” I said, “How much are the tickets?” He said, “They’re $125.” I said, “God damn! Mine are only 80.” I said, “Why do you need $250, then?” He goes, “Because I want to go with you, Dad. Please? And there it is. So, I took him to the show. And we go, we sit right up front. The lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. Then Kevin takes the stage. The crowd goes fucking nuts. Thousands of people. I was furious. The longer the show went on, the madder I got. Because his show was fucking outstanding. It was maddening. These people were fucking holding their stomachs. My son was slapping his knee. I’m like, “Damn, n i g g a, I do this, too.” Kevin says, “Good night.” The crowd goes crazy. And then everyone starts walking to his door, and the lights come on, and then my son is just standing there, looking at an empty stage. People are pushing past me, and nobody’s recognizing me. I’m like, “Man, this place fucking sucks!” I said, “Come on, son, let’s get out of here.” Then my son looks back at me and says, “Dad, please. Please, I have to meet him.” I was like, “Oh, my God.” So, I took him backstage. I’ve known Kevin for years, but can you believe I was scared to knock on his dressing room door? I almost said… “Son, I haven’t seen him for a long time.” And one of Kevin’s goons opened the door. “Hey, what’s up, Dave Chappelle? What are you doing, man? It’s good to see you, brother. What are you doing in this area? This is a terrible area.” I’m like, “Actually, I live around here. Listen… is Kevin here? My son just wanted to meet him real quick.” “I don’t know, ’cause Kevin’s about to eat dinner.” Just then, Kevin came around the corner to see who it was. “What? Oh, shit! What’s up, Dave? Come on back. I was just about to have dinner. I don’t know if you guys ate, but you’re welcome to join me if you’d like.” And then my son pushed passed me. It was some cold shit. He goes, “Actually, Mr. Hart, we haven’t eaten in several hours.” Man, Kevin took us into his back room. This guy had a fucking spread. It was Tuesday night. This motherfucker was having Sunday dinner. There were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. My son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. I was like, “Slow down, son.” He was like… Then I looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. Each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on “K-Hart” on all of them. Kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. He said, “Hey, little man. I want you to have this.” And my son was like, “Thanks, Mr. Hart.” This is when I got mad. He goes, “If your father ever makes you mad, put that on.” And he walked out. Oh, that was some cold shit. Then I realized– I looked up what Kevin made on Google. I couldn’t believe that shit. Kevin is the first comedian that a Drake song could be about. Kevin could walk around his house and sing “All Me,” and the whole song would still be true.\\n“♪ Got everything, I got everything ♪\\n♪ I cannot complain, I cannot ♪\\n♪ I don’t even know How much I really made ♪\\n♪ I forgot, it’s a lot ♪\\n♪ Fuck that, never mind what I got ♪”\\nAnd his wife will be like, “Kevin, come to bed!” He’ll be like… “♪ Ho, shut the fuck up ♪ ♪ I got way too much– ♪”\\nYou know how much money you have to have to tell a girl to shut the fuck up? I have “Quiet, please” money at best. I’d have to take a loan out for “Shut the fuck up.” “Shut the fuck up–” That’s Jay Z money. And Beyoncé got “No, you shut the fuck up” money.\\nLet’s not forget. Let’s not forget. I’ve never met Bill Cosby, so I’m not defending him. Let’s just remember that he has a valuable legacy that I can’t just throw away. I remember that he’s the first black man to ever win an Emmy in television. I also remember that he’s the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately. I remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the Super Bowl every Thursday night. And I remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of African-Americans on his show. I’m telling you, that’s no small thing. I’ve had a television show. I wouldn’t have done that shit. He gave tens of millions of dollars to African-American institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. Not just the ones he raped. Here comes the kicker. You ready? Here’s the fact that I heard, but haven’t confirmed. I heard that when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a PA system that Bill Cosby paid for. So, you understand what I’m saying? The point is this: He rapes, but he saves. And he saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape. Thank you very much!

The fourth time is not the funniest time, but it was the last time I’d see the Juice. For some reason, I was at the Kentucky Derby. It’s a very long story. This is right after I quit Chappelle’s Show in spectacular fashion. There was a party hosted by Michael Jordan, and every athlete I’ve ever admired was in that room. Yes. And then I saw a familiar face by the bar, standing there, drinking alone. It was Chris Tucker. Now… you have to remember, at this time, we were both technically missing. And we went over, and we’re talking with one another, and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together. Seeing me and Chris Tucker at that point would be like seeing Bigfoot riding a unicorn. You wouldn’t believe that’s what you were seeing. And then, through all the gawkers, a familiar face pushed through the crowd. Here he was again. The Juice. He had his camera ready. He was like, “Dave, Chris. Good to see you guys. Hey, come on, guys. Let’s all get together for a picture.” And at the same time, me and Chris were like, “No. I can’t do that. Sorry, Juice, my career is too flimsy to survive a picture with you.” That’s the end.

What should have been a triumphant farewell instead feels like a poorly executed PR stunt, filled with tired, drawn-out jokes and forced self-deprecation. Ellen spends much of the special rehashing controversies surrounding her toxic workplace allegations, but instead of addressing them meaningfully, she spins these moments into awkward jokes, coming across as defensive rather than introspective.\\nThe comedy itself is uninspired and stale, with tired observations about things like car troubles, pigeons, and aging that feel recycled from better comics. The pacing is atrocious, dragging on for what feels like an eternity, with Ellen stretching out weak material well beyond its comedic lifespan. Her attempts to balance humor with personal reflection fall flat, making it seem more like she’s fishing for sympathy rather than offering genuine entertainment.\\nWhat’s most striking is the clear disconnect between Ellen and her audience. The packed crowd of adoring fans seems willing to laugh at anything she says, but the comedy is hollow, with Ellen relying on her celebrity status rather than delivering anything truly funny or meaningful. It’s painfully obvious that this special exists not because she has anything new to say, but because she needs to reclaim some positive attention after her tarnished reputation.\\nFor Your Approval is a disappointing, self-serving finale that highlights how out of touch Ellen has become. For anyone hoping for a strong farewell from a comedy icon, this special is a huge letdown. If this is Ellen’s swan song, it’s a sour note to go out on.\\n\\n* * *\\n[gentle music playing]\\n[presenter] If you have never seen Ellen do stand-up live, you are in for a treat tonight.\\n[crowd cheering]\\nTwo minutes. [whoosh]\\n[Johnny Carson] …her first appearance on network television. Would you welcome Ellen DeGeneres. Wouldn’t it be great if we could pick up the phone and call up God and ask, “Yeah, hi, God. This is Ellen.” [chuckles] “Ellen.” “DeGeneres.” “DeGeneres.” [chuckles] “W-What’s so funny?” [chuckles] “I never thought of that. It does sound like that, doesn’t it?”\\n[audience laughs]\\nMy grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was 60. She’s 97 today. We don’t know where the hell she is.\\n[laughter]\\n[reporter 1] Ellen is on the fast track. She’s one of the top female comedians on television.\\n[reporter 2] Ellen’s new sitcom is a certifiable top-ten hit.\\n[reporter 3] The real Ellen is putting all that success and fame at risk. Susan… I’m gay.\\n[reporter 4] More than 36 million people watched her coming-out episode. Why did you think it was necessary for you to come out? Because it’s okay.\\n[echoing] [Barbara Walters] Ellen finds herself at the center of a storm of controversy.\\n[Diane Sawyer] Being accused of going too far, too gay.\\n[Ellen as Dory] When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do?\\n♪ Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming ♪\\n[reporter 5] She may have pulled off one of the greatest comebacks of all time.\\n[reporter 6] The Ellen Show has become one of the most popular shows in the world, praised for delivering a daily dose of joy with its unique mix of dancing, games, talk, and millions of dollars in audience giveaways.\\n[reporter 7] Spreading laughter seems to be working well for the entertainer and comedian, and she’s showing no signs of slowing down. A few years ago, I started ending my show by saying, “Be kind to one another.” Here’s the downside, um, I can never do anything unkind ever now, ever.\\n[reporter 8] Breaking news tonight. Is the queen of nice – really the queen of mean?\\n[sighs] [reporter 9] Respond to this with the most insane stories about Ellen being mean.\\n[woman] She’s not the happy-go-lucky nice person…\\n[reporter 10] Ellen DeGeneres is under fire again with accusations of a toxic work environment.\\n[woman 1] Toxic. Phony. Hypocrite. Liar.\\n[woman 2] Things are spiraling.\\n[voices overlapping] Ellen DeGeneres… DeGeneres… DeGeneres… [echoing builds]\\n[voices end abruptly]\\n[reporter] It’s a breaking story in the world of entertainment, and this is great, great news. Ellen is back. Although, she’s saying this new special will be her farewell.\\n[audience cheering]\\n[upbeat music playing]\\n[audience cheering excitedly] Thank you, thank you, thank ',\n",
       "  'you. Thank you so much. It seems like you still care.\\n[audience cheering] You know, I used to say that I didn’t care what other people thought of me. I realize now, looking back, I said that at the height of my popularity.\\n[audience laughs] If I look older than when you saw me last, it’s because I’m older than when you saw me last.\\n[audience laughs] And also, I stopped doing Botox and filler.\\n[audience laughing and cheering]\\nYeah. I used to do Botox back when I didn’t care what other people thought of me.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[chuckles softly] That’s when I did it. Such a waste of time to worry about what people think of us. Just a waste of energy. We’re just guessing. We don’t know. It’s impossible to know what people are thinking. I walk out here tonight and I’m hoping that you’re thinking, “This is marvelous. I’m so happy to be here.” That is my hope, but…\\n[audience cheering] Well… Good.\\n[audience laughs] But some of you could be thinking, “Let’s see how this goes.”\\n[audience laughs] Some of you may be thinking, “Why is she doing this? Does she owe back taxes?”\\n[audience laughs] I’m here because I love doing stand-up. I miss doing stand-up, and I like making people happy, and I do care what people think.\\n[audience cheering] We all care what people think. We can say we don’t. We can pretend we don’t care. All it takes is trying to parallel park in front of a crowded outdoor café.\\n[audience laughs] Spot looks big enough.\\n[audience laughs] You line it up the way you always do. You pull in, cut it a little too close. You’re scraping the hubcap the entire way along the curb. Making a very loud noise. Put it in drive, pull out. Try it again. Now you’ve overcompensated. You’re sticking so far out, you’re blocking traffic in that lane. Now you have a decision to make. Do you have the confidence to pull out and do it right this time? Or do you do that back-and-forth, back-and-forth, back-and-forth… inching your way to the curb? Knowing how long that’s gonna take, and people are watching.\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughs] The deep shame you feel when you give up and drive away.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering] Even if you’re meeting someone, you say, “I’m so sorry. I couldn’t make it.”\\n[audience laughs] And they’re like, “You did. I was sitting there, I was watching you.”\\n[audience laughs] “I started the chant.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[Ellen giggles] It’s funny how we can be embarrassed all by ourselves in a car. All by ourselves, for anything, just any stupid reason. Like, even if we just can’t figure out how to turn our windshield wipers off. Which, to me, is one of the most embarrassing things, is driving a car when it’s not raining and the windshield wipers are going. And it’s because someone decided to add a random one. We had… The windshield wiper situation was fine. We had the fast mode for when it’s raining heavily, medium, light. And then someone decided we’re just gonna wash away the rain once in a while.\\n[audience laughs] We don’t need to see all the time. And it’s always a surprise ’cause you think the rain has stopped, you’ve turned it off and you’re driving along, and five minutes later, you see this thing, like… Then you’re trying to fiddle with it, trying to turn it off, and you don’t know how ’cause it’s always different. Sometimes it’s on the end of the lever on the steering wheel. Sometimes there’s a lever within the lever, the baby lever. Like the lever had a baby and it’s inside the lever right there. Tiny baby lever. You don’t trust it ’cause you’re just waiting… Even if it’s not going, you’re like, “It’s gonna go again. I know it. I feel it.” And then finally, it does, and then you feel pretty confident about it. Then you catch the rearview mirror, your back one’s been on the whole time.\\n[audience laughs] Yeah.\\n[audience cheering] That’s what you did. You turned that one on. You turn that off, turn everything back on again. You have to sell your car.\\n[audience laughs] There’s so many extraneous things in a car we don’t need. For instance, I have never used my parking brake. I’ve never parked my car and thought, “I want it more parked than this.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering] There are things you need, the seat adjustments. Scoot forward. Lean back. You need those. Then there’s that one button that inflates the back of the seat, the one that makes you feel like you’re getting spooned by a pregnant woman.\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Oh boy.” “Ooh!” “All right.” Apparently, it’s for lumbar support. Got to support your lumbar. You got to. It’s all any of us knows about the lumbar. It’s got to be supported.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou don’t get support for your lumbar any place other than your car.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou don’t even hear about the lumbar anyplace else.\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Bill, what’s wrong? What’s happening?” “It’s my damn lumbar.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“I haven’t been driving enough lately.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nMm. [chuckling]\\nThat’s how you walk when your lumbar is out. There are buttons in my car I’ve never used, never will use. There’s a button with squiggly lines next to a misshapen peanut. I don’t know.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’ve never touched it. I’m fine. There’s a button with tally marks next to a sideways yarmulke. What the hell?\\n[audience laughs]\\nDon’t get me started on the dashboard lights too. The das',\n",
       "  'hboard lights are not illuminated all the time. So when they are, it must mean something serious, right? But “check engine”? That’s vague.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’ve checked it. It’s there.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI shouldn’t have to guess from an exclamation point between two parentheses that my tire pressure is low.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering]\\nBut if my windshield wiper fluid is low, all the words, “windshield wiper fluid low.” “Oh, my God. Pull over!”\\n[audience laughs]\\nJust ’cause I don’t know my buttons, doesn’t mean I’m stupid. Just means I’m not interested. We’re all interested in different things, all good at different things. I was talking to someone and they said, “I don’t know how you get on stage. I could never do that.” I said, “Well, I don’t know how you dry-clean clothes.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nClean clothes dryly. And then you Martinize on top of that. Some of you are in your twenties. You don’t know what Martinizing is.\\n[audience laughs]\\nNo.\\n[audience cheering]\\nIt’s not my job to explain it to you. Also, I don’t know and I never have.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah. None of us do. Let me catch you up on what’s been going on with me since you saw me last.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering] I got chickens.\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\n\\n\\nYeah.\\n[cheering] Thank you. I love them so very much. Chickens are the best bird to have at home, I think so. A lot of people think parrots, but they’re so gossipy.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou have to be really careful what you say around them. Chickens will never talk. They have little personalities. I’ve always wanted chickens. Now I have them, they’re so cute. They see me. They recognize me when I walk towards them, and they run to me. I put a swing in there for them, and they get on a swing. Chicken on a swing. That’s ridiculous.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI have a bench in there and I go sit there, and they sit on my lap, and I pet them and they fall asleep, and they give me an egg every day. They lay an egg every day. As someone who hosted a daily talk show, I can really appreciate that.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah.\\nYeah.\\n[audience cheering]\\nI’m sure they’re thinking, “I just laid an egg.” I don’t think I can do that again tomorrow.” And yet, they do. They’re curious little animals too. They’re very curious. Hey, you know how people always ask, “Why did the chicken cross the road?” I think I know, now that I have chickens. It’s their innate sense of adventure.\\n[audience laughs] [chortles]\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’m sorry to be just another comedian going on and on about her chickens.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnother thing about chickens is that, um…\\n[audience laughs]\\n…they… they fly. People think they’re flightless birds, and that is not true. They do fly. The longest recorded chicken flight is 13 seconds. Isn’t that amazing? Someone thought to time that.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah. Also, chickens dream. Scientists have discovered that chickens dream. Now listen, I love animals more than anyone, but we could take scientists working on chicken dreams and move them on over to climate change.\\n[audience laughing and cheering]\\nI’m not saying that chicken dreaming is not worth studying, it is. But we don’t need our top minds on it, I don’t think. I am curious. What do they dream about? Probably the same things we do. Probably flying. But 14 or 15 seconds for them, you know. Mm. That’s all for chickens.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah. Got to save some for the memoir.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah. Yeah.\\nYeah.\\n[cheering and applause]\\nYeah. Let me see what else I can tell you about that has been going on. Chickens…\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience laughs]\\nOh yeah, I got kicked out of show business.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah. Yeah.\\n[audience cheering]\\nThanks. Yeah, ’cause I’m mean. Yeah. You can’t be mean and be in show business. No, they’ll kick you out. No mean people in show business. I’m out. Yeah, y’all heard I was mean. Everybody heard that I was mean. Everywhere I go, I know everyone’s heard that I’m mean. I know when I walk into a restaurant, people are watching, waiting to see if I’ll be mean.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[applause]\\n“Do you think she’ll be mean first and then dance?”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Look, she… Oh, she’s reaching for butter.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“I thought she was gonna hit somebody.” “All right, I’m gonna eat. You watch now.” [inhales] That was a big story, huh? That had some legs on it. The first I heard about it, I… I came across a headline that said, “How Ellen DeGeneres became the most hated person in America.” Now, I didn’t see the other names on the ballot, but I have to…\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering loudly]\\nYeah. It’s… It’s an impressive title, it really is. It’s a… It’s a horrible thing to say about somebody, and to make it worse, there was no trophy, no awards banquet, nothing. Just the title, just, you know… I made a sash at home and I wore that around, just to… to feel like I had something, you know? It was quite a shock to me because for 17 years, there were all these polls basically saying I was one of the most trusted people in the country. There was a poll that asked people, “Which celebrity would you most want to babysit your child?” And I was the number one answer.\\n[applause]\\n[audience cheering]\\nBecause when you think “good with kids,” you immediately think childless, lesbian stand-up comedian.\\n[audie',\n",
       "  'nce laughs]\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience cheering]\\nOnce they heard that I might be mean, they didn’t want me to babysit anymore. So it wasn’t all bad. [chuckles] No. I was in therapy for a while trying to deal with all the hatred coming at me, and it was not a common situation for a therapist to deal with. My therapist said, “Ellen, where do you get this idea that everyone hates you?” And I said, “Well, um, New York Times, Washington Post, Entertainment Weekly, Us Weekly.” “I think Elmo may have said something recently on an episode of Sesame Street.” She said, “You just need to avoid looking at the news, just avoid media.” And I was like, “I am. I’m not looking at anything.” I would know when something was going on because I’d start getting text from friends saying, “Thinking of you,” or, “Sending love.” And I’d be like, “Oh.” “Why do I need love sent?” “The ‘be kind’ girl wasn’t kind.” That was the headline. Here’s the problem. I’m a comedian who got a talk show, and I ended the show every day by saying, “Be kind to one another.”\\n[audience cheering]\\nYeah. I know. It seemed like a good idea. But I became a brand, a one-dimensional character who gave stuff away and danced every day up steps. Do you know how hard it was to dance up steps? Would a mean person dance up steps? I don’t think so. Had I ended my show by saying, “Go fuck yourselves…”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering]\\n…people would have been pleasantly surprised to find out I’m kind.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI loved that show. I loved everything about that show. It was a family to me. Here’s something sweet. Sixteen people who worked there started out straight, and by the time they left, were gay.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah. You don’t see Jimmy Kimmel doing those kind of numbers.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou know what’s funny, is that when I first came out, people were afraid that watching my show would turn people gay. Which is ridiculous. You have to work there. You have to fill out a W-2. And then, you turn gay. We had so much fun together at that show. We laughed all the time. We played games all the time. I started a game of tag in, like, 2016 that we played all the way till when the show ended ’cause I just loved playing games. We played tag, and I would chase people down the hallways, I would chase them around the studio and scare them all the time. I would jump out, scare people ’cause I would love to do that, and… Hearing myself say this out loud, I… realize I was chasing my employees and terrorizing them. I can see where that would be misinterpreted. Well… We had morning meetings every morning in my office. The producers would come in, writers would come in, and we’d talk about what we were gonna do on the show that day. And Andy Lassner was one of my executive producers.\\n[audience cheering]\\nYeah. Uh, Andy is a very nervous man, and he… Everything scares him. He could drop his pen and it would startle him. He’s just a nervous man. And Alison was one of my writers who was scared of snakes. Anything snake-related. So, sometimes, before they’d come into my office, we would hide rubber snakes in a panel in the ceiling, and I had a button that I could push that would release the snakes down…\\n[audience exclaims]\\nAgain, hearing myself say this out loud… But they liked it. [chuckles] They did. There are a lot of perks with having your own television show. Number one has to be the ability to say to someone, “We should have a panel in the ceiling that releases snakes.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd then another adult says, “Yeah, we’ll get that started right away.” Scaring was just a big component of the show. We would… You know, we started with scaring guests, and I don’t remember exactly how it started. It was some simple, like… I think Chris Hemsworth, or some big strong guy that was on the show, we found out was scared of crickets. So we had someone dress as a cricket and sneak up behind his chair when he was talking, and… [roars] …you know, make a cricket noise and scare him. And then it just escalated. We just decided to make it more surprising to people, and, eventually, we, uh, built a table that looked like the table between me and the guest, but it was actually a box where someone could pop out and scare them. But the guests got wise to that, and if they saw that it was a box, they would open it and look in the box. So we built a tunnel under the stage that went into the box… so that when they checked it, it was empty, and then they’d close it, and somebody would crawl into the box from underneath. I was a very immature boss.\\n[audience laughs] I didn’t want to be a boss. I didn’t go to business school. I went to Charlie’s Chuckle Hut. It looked like I was the boss. The show is called Ellen, and everybody’s wearing T-shirts that say Ellen, and there were buildings all over the Warner Bros. lot that said Ellen. But I don’t think that meant that I should be in charge. I don’t think that Ronald McDonald’s the CEO of McDonald’s. [applause]\\n[audience cheering] Everything I knew about being a boss, I learned from movies. And those were things like saying, “Jenkins, my office, now!” Or, “The name’s Frank, how the hell are you?” But those were men bosses. Women bosses didn’t come along for a while, not till around the time of Martinizing, I think.\\n[audience laughs]\\nNo. But men bosses a',\n",
       "  'nd women bosses are different. Like, a woman boss couldn’t say, “Jenkins, my office, now.” A woman boss would have to use more words. A woman boss would have to say something like, “Excuse me, Jenkins. I don’t want to bother you.” “If you’re not too busy, could you step into my office real quick?” “I just have to talk to you for a second. Thank you so much.”\\n[audience cheering]\\n‘Cause women are raised in a different way. At least I was. I was raised to be a people pleaser. I was taught, when I was a little girl, to be small and quiet and agreeable. And it’s crazy what I’ve done with my life, ’cause I’m exactly the opposite of how I was raised to be.\\n[audience cheering]\\nYeah. Most women aren’t raised with confidence. We just aren’t. We’re too self-conscious, which is why you rarely see a woman playing air guitar.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering]\\nI love how they make it like it’s hard. Like something’s happening there. Men can get away with acting out things that aren’t actually happening and not look crazy, somehow. A man, in the middle of nowhere, and for no reason, can practice an imaginary golf swing. Just…\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering]\\n“Oh, no, I’m not in line.” “I’m just waiting for my latte. You go ahead.” [chuckles] Men’ll jump up and see if they can slap the top of a doorframe.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’ve never had that urge. “I wonder if I could hit that?” “Tiffany, hold my purse. I’m gonna give it a try.”\\n[audience cheering]\\n[groans] “I couldn’t do it! I didn’t. Give me my purse. I didn’t do it.” Good. We have all these unwritten rules based on gender, of acceptable behavior, of who we’re allowed to be and how we’re allowed to act. If we don’t follow those rules, it makes people uncomfortable. When people get uncomfortable, there are consequences. For those of you keeping score, this is the second time I’ve been kicked out of show business. [audience laughs and cheers] Yeah. Kicked me out before ’cause I told them I was gay. No gay people in show business.\\n[audience laughs]\\nNo. They’ll kick you out. Can’t be gay and be in show business. Eventually, they’re gonna kick me out a third time for being old. Mean, old, and gay. The triple crown.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering]\\nI knew it was a risk to tell people I was gay ’cause I knew a lot of people didn’t like gay people. If they did, we wouldn’t have needed the parade. Listen, we don’t like all of you either, but we don’t make a big thing about it.\\n[audience cheering]\\nMost of us get into this business because we didn’t get enough love or attention as a child. So we go into a business that depends on people liking us to be successful. What’s wrong with us? [chuckles] For me, it was never about the money. It was about healing my childhood wounds. I thought if I could make people happy, then they’ll like me. And if they like me, I’ll feel good about myself. And all I can say about that is, “Thank God for the money.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n‘Cause it’s a fickle business. They liked me for a long time. I was on a sitcom, I made them laugh. They liked me, then I told them I was gay, and they didn’t like me. Then I got a talk show, and I gave them TVs and cars, and I danced, and they liked me. Then they heard a rumor I was mean, they didn’t like me. So it’s been a real test for my ego and my self-esteem because there’s such extremes in this business. There are people who love you and idolize you, and then there are people who hate you, just really loudly hate you. So, sometimes, I long for my childhood, when I just had good old-fashioned neglect.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWhat was wrong with that? [chuckles] It’s been two years since the show ended and it’s been an adjustment, because for 19 years, I drove onto the Warner Bros. lot, passed a giant billboard of my face. So the first thing I did was I had a giant billboard of my face installed on my lawn, so I saw that when I drove in. Yeah, then I put an “applause” sign in the dining room, and that’s helping also. But, really, I’ve only known myself working for 40 years. That’s all I’ve done, is work. So I didn’t really have a lot of free time and didn’t have hobbies. Now there’s a lot of free time, so I’m trying to figure out what to do with that. So I got the chickens, remember? I don’t know if you… Yeah. I decided to take up gardening ’cause everybody talks about gardening and how great gardening is. It’s not.\\n[audience laughs]\\nNo. It’s really not. I got the overalls and the tool belt and the hat. I looked adorable. I did. But I find once you put the plants in the ground, you’re no longer gardening. You’re just waiting, you know? I tell people I grew these strawberries, but at best I was just there when it happened. It’s the sun and the sprinklers that should take the credit. I’m more like the strawberries’ godmother showing up on its birthday. “Look how big you’re getting.”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughs]\\n“See you at Christmas, maybe.” It is relaxing to be out there, though. Mainly ’cause the garden gloves make it impossible for me to look at my phone. Yeah. Sometimes, I’ll put the garden gloves on and go inside and lay down. Yeah. It’s just as relaxing, really. My garden gloves and my sweatpants… I live in sw… When I’m at home, I just wear sweatpants. I don’t understand people who don’t just wear sweatpants at home',\n",
       "  '. Like, what’s the point, you know?\\n[audience cheering]\\nYeah. I take off my going-out clothes. I take those off, put on my staying-home clothes. Once I’m in my sweatpants, I’m not leaving. Not leaving the house. A few weeks ago, a friend of mine texted me, and he said, “Would you like to come over for a last-minute dinner party for Mick?” As in Jagger. [audience exclaims] Now, I’ve never met Mick Jagger, and I would love to meet Mick Jagger, but I was in my sweatpants already, and I was not leaving.\\n[audience cheering]\\nThat’s what I told him, and he could not believe that was the reason I wasn’t going. I guess most people would make something up because it is a ridiculous reason, and I know that, but it was the truth. You know? And, you know, people say honesty is the best policy. I don’t know why they say that. It’s only the best policy if it’s something you want to hear, really. Like, there are certain degrees of honesty. If you tell someone there’s something stuck in their teeth, they don’t love that, but they kind of appreciate that and they’ll take that. But as soon as you tell someone that all of their stories should be 50% shorter…\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah.\\n[audience cheering]\\n…you lose 100% of their friendship, is what happens. People say it’s hard to tell the truth. For me, it’s hard not to tell the truth. Which is why it was really difficult for me to keep my sexuality a secret, because I felt such guilt for not being honest about who I was. I felt shame for how society was making me feel. I felt fear for what would happen to my career if I did come out. Ultimately, I decided it’s more important for me to be honest about who I am.\\n[audience cheering]\\nYeah. Yeah. They say, “The truth will set you free,” and it did. I was free for three years.\\n[audience laughs]\\nNobody would hire me. Truth will make you broke. People lie so much these days, they really do. You can tell, because they make such a big deal of it when they’re telling the truth. They’ll say things like, “Well, to tell you the truth…” or, “If I’m being honest…” If you’re being honest? I prefer it the other way around. “Listen, I’m gonna lie to you here.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“That lasagna was phenomenal.”\\n[audience laughs] Most people tell me that they appreciate my honesty because they know where they stand with me, but someone did suggest that I get tested to see if I’m on the spectrum. And, uh, I’m not on the spectrum. And I wouldn’t care if I was on the spectrum, but I’m not. Well, I am on the spectrum.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWe all are. It’s a spectrum.\\n[audience laughing and cheering]\\nI’m on the part of the spectrum where someone on the spectrum would have a problem with me saying I’m on the spectrum, so… Yeah, that’s right. But I may have OCD because a therapist said so. And I said, “Yes, I am very organized,” because I thought that was the “O.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nI didn’t know what OCD was. I was raised in a religion, Christian Science, that doesn’t acknowledge diseases or disorders. So, when I was growing up, nobody talked about anything. There was no discussion of anything. I look back now, and I realize my dad for sure had OCD. He would check the doorknob 15 times before we would leave. He would check the faucet 15 times. He would unplug all the appliances before we left the house because lightning could strike, and it would catch fire. They say it could be hereditary. So I went home and I asked Portia, I said, “Do you think I may have OCD?” And she said, “Yes, you do.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nBarely got that sentence out, really. It’s funny, I’ve never thought of myself as obsessive. I think of myself as careful, and everyone else careless and out of control.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI asked her what I obsess about, and she said, “You obsess about time.” And that is true. I don’t like to be late. I like to be on time. So, sometimes, that makes us early. This is the example she said I should share with you. I, um… There are many, but this is the one she said. Usher was having an after-party for the Grammys one year, and we got there so early, it was just us and the staff.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYup. Yup. We helped place candles on tables.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering]\\n[chuckles] I invoiced him $200. These are my confessions. I just don’t know why the invitation says a certain time for a party to start, and then everyone goes an hour or two later. People seem to think that 6:00 means 7:00, 7:00 means 8:00, 8:00 means 9:00. 9:00 means nothing to me, ’cause I’m not going.\\n[audience laughs]\\n9:00. Who starts something at 9:00? Anyway, I obsess on time, and, uh, I obsess on animals. I know I obsess on animals ’cause I love them too much. Like, way too much. I think about how they see things and what they feel and what they think. And I worry about butterflies in rainstorms, and how delicate they are, and how their little tiny feet are holding on to a blade of grass, trying to… Winds blowing… The rain is happening on their little tiny wings… Saturating their wings, and their feet holding… Especially if it’s a butterfly. What if it’s his first day, and they’re, like, “Is this life? This is horrible.” Ooh… [chuckling] “I should have stayed a caterpillar.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[chuckling] The monarch butterfly, think about that. How crazy is that story? You know',\n",
       "  ' the story. I don’t have to tell you. But I will. The little tiny caterpillar…\\n[audience laughs]\\nI mean, how does it even make it past the caterpillar stage? It’s a larva, and then that somehow gets into a caterpillar. And a caterpillar just… And somehow, it just knows instinctively it’s time for that part of its life to change. “That’s done. I’m gonna put myself into a chrysalis.” And then it turns into liquid somehow. And then it becomes a butterfly flying for the first time. And it looks drunk and confused, the way they, you know…\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd they make it to Mexico that way. I don’t know how.\\n[audience cheering]\\nThe butterfly is beautiful, and people talk about the butterfly, but the butterfly wouldn’t be the butterfly without the caterpillar. I mean, the deep knowing that that caterpillar has. Its only perspective is crawling on the ground and it’s looking at other crawling things saying, “I’m gonna fly someday.” “And I’m gonna go to Mexico.” And they’re like, “No, you’re not.” “And what’s Mexico?” But I don’t know if we really fully appreciate what that metamorphosis is. The fact that it’s a caterpillar, it knows to change and becomes this other thing entirely. That’s genius. It’s brilliance. And the octopus, the octopus being able to change texture and shape and form and color instantaneously, depending on what it’s on. That’s genius. A colony of ants or of bees, the way they communicate, and there’s no chaos between all of those things. Everything in nature is living up to its full potential. But I am so disappointed in pigeons.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWhat happened to them? I mean, pigeons, they have built-in GPS in their beaks. And they can fly for hundreds of miles. In World War II, they saved lives. They were taking messages from generals to other generals and saving lives. There are pictures of them in the newspaper with medals, not pinned, but around their necks, that they received for what they did in World War II, and now look at them. Just pecking at old gum in filthy alleyways and parking lots. They could be anywhere. I would feel sorry for them, but they made a choice.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI mean, they barely fly anymore. They… They’re just, uh, filthy. And even if a car is coming, they don’t even fly to get out of the way. “All right. Okay, all right. Okay!” “All right. Okay, okay, all right. Okay!” [applause]\\n[audience cheering]\\nSometimes, it looks like they’re gonna do something important. You’ll see a bunch, and they all get up at once. Again, that kind of communication. All of them get up at once, they fly, and they just go in one big circle, and they go right back to where they were. God, you guys. Not living up to their potential. I rescued a pigeon one time. I’ll rescue anything. I’ve always tried to save animals my whole life. But I saw a one-legged pigeon on the street near where I lived, and I took it home because I knew it wasn’t gonna make it on the street and I didn’t know how to take care of it. I mean, never had a pigeon, so I just threw gum and trash down…\\n[audience laughs] …dirt, thinking that’s what it eats. You know, because I’ve never seen it… It didn’t make it. I’ll rescue anything. I really will. And if I see a sign of someone posting a cat or a dog missing, when they post those pictures, I will drive around and I will try to find that animal. And it’s not just for the reward money.\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s not. No. I rescued a dog one time. I was driving, and I see this dog all by itself, and I get out of the car, and it’s soaking wet. I’m like, “Oh my God, what happened to you?” Take it home, dry it off, stays with me for the night. Put out posters the next afternoon. Get a call from the people saying, “Thank God. Where did you find it?” And I told them, and they said, “That’s where we live.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah. They said, “We had just given it a bath, and we put her on the lawn to dry out.” It was pretty close to the sidewalk when I saw it. [chuckles] Anyway, I obsess on things. I have ADD, and I blame the talk show for that because for 19 years, I was talking to people in five-minute segments. When I’m at a party and someone’s talking to me longer than five minutes, I have the urge to say, “I’m sorry, we have to take a break.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheering]\\nParties are hard for me. Parties are very hard for me. People are wanting to talk and stuff, and… [inhales] They always talk about books they’re reading. I don’t read. I want to. I try to read, but my ADD makes it really hard for me. As much as I try to focus on the words, I end up thinking about a sandwich I had earlier that day. Moby Dick, for me, is two pages about a whale and 425 pages about me wondering if I should grow my hair out or keep it short.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’ve had it short for a while. I should try to grow it out, probably. Maybe to my shoulder-length or something like that. Not much longer than that. I wonder how long that would take, though? I should probably keep it short, I think. That’s better. Why not try something different, though? I should. Oh, yeah. Oh, it’s done. Yeah.\\n[audience cheering]\\nYeah, my ADD makes it really hard for me to sit down and focus on anything at all. Like, do you know how hard it was for me to put this together? Of course you don’t. Why would I ask t',\n",
       "  'hat question? Why do people ask people questions they know they don’t have the answer to? Why do people say, “Guess what I did yesterday?” Do I have to? Is it a game? Is there a prize? I don’t want to. “You’ll never guess what I did yesterday.” You’re right, I won’t. I won’t. Probably not. Unless it’s something really average, like you had lunch. You said I’ll never guess, so it’s probably something weird, like you got a chinchilla and named it “Stewart.” I don’t know. So it’s hard for me to focus, and I get, like… When I was thinking about pigeons and how disappointed I was in them, I was… I remembered that I had rescued the pigeon ’cause I’d forgotten. I was like, “Yeah, I rescued that one-legged pigeon.” And when I wrote down “legged,” I did the hyphen thing, and I thought, “leg-ged” or “legged”? Is it “legged”? “One-leg-ged”? “One-legged” pigeon or “one-leg-ged”? It’s not “one arm-med.” You don’t “one arm-med.” Armed. But it’s two Gs, so “leg-ged”? You don’t go, “I beg-ged for food.” No. You don’t stay, “I got mug-ged.” It’s “leg-ged.” Or “legged.” “One-leg pigeon.” “One-legged”? “One-leg-ged.” “One-leg pigeon.” “One-leg-ged.” “One-leg pigeon”? “One-leg-ged pigeon.” A one-leg… “One-leg-ged.” “One-leg pigeon.” “One-leg-ged” pigeon.\\n[audience cheering]\\nSo, I have ADD. I have OCD. I’m losing my memory. But I think I’m well-adjusted because I obsess on things but don’t have the attention span to stick with it, then I forget what I was obsessing about in the first place. So it takes me all the way around to being well-adjusted, I think. Yeah. [applause] [chuckles] I’m very impatient. That is a problem for me. I’m very impatient. It’s hard for me to live in the moment. We’re supposed to live in the moment. But every moment… Eh… The spiritual teacher Ram Dass wrote a book called Be Here Now. I’d like to write one for people with ADD and call it, Yeah, but What’s That over There?\\n[audience laughs]\\nThere are all these books out there telling us how to live, telling us why we’re here. ‘Cause why are we here, really? I mean, obviously, to gossip and make fun of each other on the internet, but why else? These things I think about now that I’m older. I’m 66 years old, and I…\\n[audience cheering]\\nThank you. That’s how you know you’re old, you get the applause.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou don’t get it when you’re 30, or even in your 50s. It starts around 60. So I don’t like the word “old.” I think it’s a bad word. It just sounds bad. “Old.” “Is that bread still good?” “No, that’s old.” “Old.” And I don’t feel old. The only time I feel old is when I’m in a restaurant trying to read a menu. That is the only time I feel old. Yeah. [applause] You know all the reasons. It’s like, too dark in there. It’s always too dark. And the way they think they’re gonna help, they put a tealight candle on the table. Which does nothing. I blow it out. I just blow it out and, “Oh, okay.” You’re gonna light it again? All right, I’m just gonna… Because it doesn’t do anything. That’s why. Why are you lighting… Okay, I’ll do it again. I’m just gonna put it in my pocket. How about that? You can’t see. And if you put your flashlight on your phone to try to read the menu, that just automatically says, “Old.” That’s just… That’s… They should come with a sound effect. When you put the flashlight on… “Old!” It should just be “Old!” And even if you can see, the print is so small. I don’t know who is printing these menus, but the print is so tiny. It’s like they’re using a jeweler’s loupe to make the font. It’s tiny, tiny font. You can’t read it. I’m like, “Can you see that?” “Does that say ‘tortilla’ or ‘trampoline?’ What does that say to you?” “I can’t see anything. Yeah.” “Hi. Okay, I’ll go ahead and order. “I’m gonna get the pasta with stem cells.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nThey have a children’s menu. They should have a larger-print menu for older people with a bendy light so you can see it.\\n[audience cheering]\\nOr, even better, they should come out in audiobook. A menu could be an audio… Meryl Streep reads The Cheesecake Factory. “Pancakes.” [chuckling] [chuckling] I don’t do impressions, that’s… “Pancakes.” When you’re this age, the doctors start asking you to come in for checkups. Even though there’s nothing wrong with you, they just want to see you. It’s a scam. They’re just looking for stuff. They ask you all kinds of personal stuff. “How many drinks per week do you have?” First of all, it’s none of your business.\\n[audience cheering]\\nSecond of all, I’m gonna lie to you here. Three.\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Drinks per week.” How about I start with “per day” before I do that math, okay? “Carry the two.” They just look for stuff. My doctor said, “When’s the last time you had a bone density test?” And I said, “A what?” “Bone density test.” I said, “I’ve never had a bone density test.” “Well, at your age, you should get one.” I said, “Why? I’m in good shape.” “No, you should get one at your age.” So I got the stupid bone density test. I’m off the charts. Below it. I have full-on osteoporosis. I don’t even know how I’m standing up right now.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’m like a human sandcastle. I could disintegrate in the shower. I have to take that Prolia shot every six months. Remember the commercial where the woman’s walking and a kid darts out on the skateboard or someth',\n",
       "  'ing… “Whoa!” “Whoa!” That’s me. It’s hard to be honest about aging and seem cool. Hey, if you got arthritis in your knee, make some noise!\\n[audience cheering]\\nOh! Me, too. I just had excruciating pain one day, and I thought I tore a ligament or something. I got the MRI, and they’re, like, “No, it’s just arthritis.” I said, “How’d I get that?” He goes, “It just happens at your age.” All these things just happen at your age. It’s around the time you start watching Wheel of Fortune.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah. There’s no buildup, you just find yourself sitting there enjoying it one day. “That’s a pretty gown Vanna’s wearing.” The prizes are tricky on there, I find. I think they really are. I had a 20-minute conversation about this the other day. If you land on the dollar amount, the $300, or the $1,500, you get that, right? But if you land on the car. Honk, honk! Half a car, by the way. You’re trying to land on the million dollars, that’s what you want. But the million dollars is sandwiched in between two bankrupts. If you freeze-frame it, you’ll notice that the bankrupts are a little bit larger than the sliver of the million dollars. You’ll see when you freeze-frame it, it’s just… When you land on it, you’re like, “I got a million dollars!” But no, you don’t. You have to have so many other things that line up to get that, which I was telling myself when Portia walked in and said, “Who are you talking to?”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[applause]\\n[chuckles] Another thing that happens when you age, you just start talking to yourself. I’d probably be doing this exact same thing right now if you weren’t here.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAging is very interesting. Aging is tough on its own, but aging… Then you have aging parents, which a lot of people are dealing with now, which is really, really tough. My father is no longer with us. Well, he was never with you, um…\\n[audience laughs]\\n[chuckles] My mother has dementia now, and, um… which is a horrible disease. And so many people are dealing with it right now. My mother is lucky in the sense that she doesn’t know she has it. So she’s actually happy. She’s really happy. She’s in a really nice place. I have her in, uh… a facility that… They have a lot of activities to keep them stimulated. There’s painting, and arts and crafts, and bus rides, and different things that happen, um… I don’t know whose idea this was, but someone booked a magician.\\n[audience laughs]\\nHe… [chuckles] He was so excited to be there. He was wearing a tuxedo that fit him at one point in his life, and… he’s sitting, and he’s got a table. Thirteen women in different stages of dementia, and… “Pick a card.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nEh? “I can’t see it. What is it?” “It’s a queen of hearts.” “No, don’t tell her. I want you to look at it, and just…” “You just look at that and remember it, okay.” “All right.” “Put it back in the deck now.” He goes through the whole thing. “Is this your card?” “No.” “Yes, it is!”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Yes!” “That’s your card!” “No.” “You picked that card. Put it back in.” Oh, he got so mad. He just… He didn’t even have to do anything. He could have left the room and come back. “Oh, a magician!” You know, they would have been like… [chuckling] God… [chuckles] [chuckles] It’s always interesting having a conversation with her. You never know what you’re gonna get. And not too long ago, she said, “You didn’t go to college, did you?” I said, “No.” She goes, “That’s a shame. I would have been so proud of you.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nI said, “Well, I think I did okay.” “I had that show you liked. Remember the show?” “Yeah, I still watch it every day.” I said, “No, I don’t think so, um…” “Yeah, I watch it every day.” I said, “No, it’s not on anymore.” And she goes, “Then, who am I watching?”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Kelly Clarkson. Judge Judy. I don’t know.” “Well, yesterday’s was very good. It was the best one yet.” Okay. You know, I realize now that my whole life was wrapped up in that show, and my mother’s whole identity was being Ellen’s mom. And now I don’t have a show, and she doesn’t know she’s my mom. She just thinks I’m a nice lady that visits her. Although, there’s a good chance she thinks I’m Kelly Ripa, but…\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\n\\n\\nBut she’s happy, and that’s all that matters.\\n[audience cheering]\\nAnd I’m happy too.\\n[audience cheering]\\nUh… Yeah. I’m happy not being a boss or a brand or a billboard, just a person. Just a multifaceted person with different feelings and emotions, and I can be happy and sad and compassionate or frustrated. I have OCD and ADD. I’m honest. I’m generous. I’m sensitive and thoughtful. But I’m tough and I’m impatient and I’m demanding. I’m direct. I’m a strong woman.\\n[audience cheering]\\n[mouthing] Thank you.\\n[cheering continues] Thank you. Thank you so much. I’m proud of who I’ve become. When you’re a public figure, you’re open to everyone’s interpretation. I’m sure you’ve heard the saying, “What other people think of me is none of my business.” People will say all kinds of things, and you have no control over that. But you know the truth, and that’s all that matters. But that is easier said than done because being in this business, I have had to care what people think. Because being a comedian or a host, it’s our only real currency for success. If they like you, you’re in, and if they don’t',\n",
       "  ', you’re out. And I’ve spent an entire lifetime trying to make people happy, and I’ve cared far too much what other people think of me. So the thought of anyone thinking that I’m mean was devastating to me, and it consumed me for a long time. But with time, you gain perspective, which is one good thing about aging. It doesn’t totally make up for arthritis and brittle bones, but…\\n[audience laughs]\\nBut with perspective, you realize that caring what people think, to a degree, is healthy. But not if it affects your mental health.\\n[audience cheering]\\nSo after a lifetime of caring, I just can’t anymore. So I don’t.\\n[audience cheering]\\nBut, if I’m being honest…\\n[audience laughs]\\n…and I have a choice of people remembering me as someone who is mean, or someone who is beloved. “Belove-ed”? “Beloved”?\\n[audience laughs]\\nBeloved. Someone who is beloved? Someone who is “belove-ed.” Beloved. “Beloved-ed.” Someone who’s beloved. Someone who is “beloved-ed.” Someone who is beloved. I choose that.\\nThank you.\\n[audience cheering]\\n[whooping]\\nThank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Have a seat. Thank you so much. Wow. Wow. [audience whooping] Well… Wow. Um… First of all… First of all, that was just, um, unbelievably beautiful, and, um… You know, there is just nothing better than being surrounded by endorphins and joy, and we don’t get that that often now, and this was beautiful tonight. This was absolutely…\\n[audience cheering]\\nI, um… [clears throat] I had no intention of doing a special. I had no intention of doing anything ever again after the show. And I really, uh… I didn’t think I’d ever find the funny in it. And the fact that I have been able to travel and do this and see the love and support that is still there for me, which I didn’t know I had.\\n[audience cheering]\\nUm… It is… It’s been… It’s been beyond healing to say the words every night, to-to feel the support and the love. And so I am so glad I got to do this. I’m so glad I got to say goodbye on my terms, and I can’t thank you enough.\\n[audience cheering]\\nUm… This is a night I will always remember. And, uh, I… I just… I just… Thank you. And I just want to bring my wife out here ’cause it’s our anniversary.\\n[audience cheering]\\n[“Golden” by Jill Scott playing]\\nShe’s crying…\\n[cheering continues]\\nThank you, everybody.

[Upbeat music playing] Hello! Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. [Chuckles] Thank you, Boston. I appreciate that. [Whooping] Uh, that’s very sweet of you. [Man] Love you! I’m at the end of the tour right now. I’m very happy to be on tour because I now have a child. Ah, so… any time out of home is good for me. Um, I got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months. So… [Audience cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Life decisions. And she’s a nice girl, and I love her in a way, sure. My problem with my girlfriend is, she’s very sweet, but she’s shit at telling stories, and I’m awesome at telling stories, so it really bothers me when she talks. And I don’t know if that’ll be a problem in the future, but it’s a problem now and I don’t see it getting better. Um… I’ll give you an example, right? I was in the car, and my son Hank was asleep in the back seat, and we’re driving along, and on the radio comes Madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, “Oh, I used to party with Madonna.” And I went, “You fucking what, when?” And she went, “I used to party with Madonna.” Now, I should fill you in a little bit on this. My girlfriend used to be a model in Miami, right? I’m not bragging. I didn’t get the model years. I didn’t get those years. I’ve seen the photos. Very impressive. Um… So, I said, “So you used to party with Madonna. Madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?” And she went, “No, no, it would just be me and a few other people.” I go, “You need to elaborate on this story right now.” And she goes, “Oh, okay, I used to date the center for the Miami Heat.” As soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an NBA center, even if this guy’s even slightly in proportion… a lot of things flood through your head. First thing is, “That’s why your cunt’s so fucked up.” That’s a big one. “That’s why our child came out while you were walking. I understand.” So she said, “I used to date the center for the Miami Heat. His best friend was Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman used to go out with Madonna, and we used to go over to Madonna’s house.” And she goes, “This one time, the four of us were over at Madonna’s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another…” And then I went, “Shut the fuck up!” And she went, “What?” I said, “I know what ‘one thing led to another’ means! You all started fucking each other!” And she went, “We did. We started…” “Just shut up!” And she goes, “What do you care for?” I said, “You’re the mother of my child! I don’t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7’2″ NBA player while you’re licking out Madonna’s muscular vagina and Dennis Rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going…” [Moaning] And she goes, “Oh, you’re being silly. What do you care for? You’ve partied way more than I have in my life.” And I went, “That is not true. I’ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but I have, in no way, partied way more than you have. Often, I get wasted just by myself. I wouldn’t call it a party.” For most of my career, I was a struggling comedian, right? And this is how struggling comedians party, right? It’s 5:00 a.m., Monday, right? We’re in a one-bedroom apartment. Seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. One of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories… and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. One of us has come up with a plan. The plan goes like this, “Well… nurses will be finishing their shift soon. Maybe if we just stand out the front of the ER, they’ll appreciate seven funny guys.” [Chuckles] I don’t… You know, I’ve never partied like a model. I have partied twice in my life. Twice. Like, really partied. I’ve had good nights out, but I’ve really partied twice. If you really party, and most people never experience this, it’s an amazing thing. It happens in Vegas. It can only happen in Vegas, and it’s gotta involve celebrity, right? I’m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and I was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. And then there’s the night club, but then there’s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. It’s only a little room. And you go back there and you can just… They encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you’re just doing it off a key, [Sniffs] and they’re going, “No, dude. Use the table. Don’t use your…” And I go, “Oh, oh. Oh, sorry. Um…” And it’s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. Just bring ’em in like, “Huh?” And you can do this. You can go… “Uh…” Like that. And they’ll drag these women away. It is the best thing you’ll ever do with your life. When you party that hard as a man, there’s a lot of remorse ’cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. You wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. You go, “Oh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I spent $5,000.” When a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, “Oh, my God. We partied so hard ',\n",
       "  'last night. I made $5,000.” And that’s a vastly different emotion that… I don’t think women will never… Yeah, okay.\\nThis is the thing. In America, at the moment, they’re trying to raise the minimum wage to, I don’t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, “And still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.” And of course, that’s disgusting. How dare women earn so much? Like… a lot of things that I say tonight will be jokes that I don’t actually mean, but this is something I’m really passionate about. Women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. I’m sorry. I… [Audience whooping] I’m not being a misogynistic bastard, right? I’m not saying that women don’t work as hard. I’m sure they do. I’m not saying they don’t do as good a job. What I’m saying is they don’t deserve to earn as much money as men. Right? Men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and Jim Jefferies tickets and all that shit! [Audience cheering] Now… I’m sure there’s women in this room that are saying, “Oh, I pay for my drinks. I bought my own ticket.” And don’t think we don’t appreciate the uglies, ’cause we do. Right? We do. But there’s little things in society that you can’t change. Men have extra expenses that you’ll never understand. There’s holidays that are just for women. Like Valentine’s Day is just for women. They say it’s for romantics. They say it’s for couples or something like that. It’s just for women. There’s no man who gets excited by Valentine’s Day. There’s no man that when he sees the Valentine’s Day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, “Oh, Valentine’s Day is coming!” Valentine’s Day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, “How much money do I have to spend today so that you won’t act like a cunt?” It doesn’t stop there. Mother’s Day! Mother’s Day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. My girlfriend’s first Mother’s Day. And she went, “Oh, I wonder what I’ll get for Mother’s Day.” And I went, “Probably fucking nothing. He’s got no money. He’s six months old. What do you think he’s gonna buy you?” Within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person I was and how important Mother’s Day is to a new mum, you know? And so, I went and bought her a cappuccino machine ’cause I assumed that’s what Hank would have wanted her to have… and I wrote a card. I’m not a bastard. I wrote a card. I’m right-handed. So I got my left hand. Every new dad knows this. You get the crayon and you go, [Imitating child] “Happy Mother’s Day. Love, Hank.” And I went, “H-A-N…” And then I did the “K” back-to-front because he’s a fucking moron. See, now I know there’s people in the room, they’re thinking, “Well, fathers have Father’s Day.” Father’s Day is bullshit. It’s fucking shit, Father’s Day. Father’s Day came around and my girlfriend went, “What do you want for Father’s Day?” And I went, “I don’t want anything. Don’t even worry about it. I don’t want anything.” And she goes, “Come on. You gotta have something.” I said, “Honestly, I don’t want anything.” And she goes, “Come on.” And I went, “It’s my fucking money. Just don’t touch it. Just leave my money alone. How hard is this? How about, for 24 hours, you don’t touch my fucking money? That would be a gift.” That’s why every single father has that one Father’s Day gift that they cherish, and it’s shit! It’s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle’s too big, and it says, “I heart Dad.” And they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. And do you wanna know why they like it? Every now and again, they look at it and go… “That cost me nothing, that mug.” [Audience whooping] See… wouldn’t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn’t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? I’ve got it, right? April 18th… Anal Sex Day. [Men cheering loudly] It’s good, isn’t it? Everyone’s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on April 18th. It’s nice. A month before, you’d be walking around the shopping center going, “Oh, the decorations are up!” [Men whooping] And it’s good ’cause if your bird didn’t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on Valentine’s Day when they don’t get a gift. You could go like, “Oh, me mate, Jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. Yeah, obviously, they’re more connected than we are. They’ve, uh…” I’m thinking, I don’t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but I’m thinking of bringing out some April 18th T-shirts. Not even putting “Jim Jefferies” on them or anything. Just T-shirts that say, “April 18th.” ‘Cause it’s good, right? You’re in a bar. You’re a guy. You see a guy at the other end of the bar with an April 18th, and you go… Fucking friends for life, right? But even better, you see a girl with an April 18th T-shirt.\\nThe weird thing is I’m bigging-up anal sex here, and I don’t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. I’m not even a huge fan. I much prefer the cunt. I think it’s a much more… I think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. But, you know, anal sex… Oh, you know… I do it. I get involved, ’cause I feel like I have to. You know, I… But I’ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, I, uh… When I watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. The girl’s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh… But the thing is, you can’t smell porn. You don’t smell porn. You just… You just watch it. They never… And it’s different, porn. It’s different. They clean the girl’s asshole. They pump water into it until it’s very hygienic. I’m sure. And the girl seems to be so happy. She’s like… You’ve got it in her pussy, you’re fucking her, and then she’s like, “Put it in my ass.” She’s inviting. It’s like you’re doing her a favor in porn. And then she’s like… She says things… I don’t know, things like, “I’m enjoying that. Keep putting it in my ass. Fuck my ass. I love a cock in my ass.” And… And the experience I’ve had in my own life has been',\n",
       "  ' vastly different. I’ve… My experience has been a lot of crying. Now, although that can help you come at times, it’s not what you want… It’s not what you want for every day. I like the girl who acts like she’s enjoying it. Like, you know when your girlfriend’s like, “I’m gonna act like I enjoy it.” She does that whole, “Yeah. Oh, no, that’s good.” [Moaning] Ahh! ♪ I’m having a good time ♪ And then they’re always going, “Are you done? Are you close to done?” You never fuck a pussy and they go, “Are you almost done? Finish this.” Like that. If you’re fucking ass, they don’t want you… They want it all over, quick. And they do other things, the porn girls. I don’t know how much they get paid. I’m sure it’s more than what the men get paid. It’s the opposite bit of society. Um… But they do a thing called “ATM.” I don’t know if you know what that is, kids. That stands for “ass to mouth.” That’s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she’ll put it directly in her mouth, and she’ll say something like, “I love the taste of my ass. Let me taste my ass.” And then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work… [Applause] she’s been doing. Now, I had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she’d be all wild and try that. Once again, vastly different experience. I’m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and I don’t know of any man, if they’re truthful, really is. Now, there’s women in the room who are thinking, “Well, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?” [Woman shouting] What a good question. [Woman whoops] Women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because… we know you fucking hate it. [Cheering]\\nSo… I’m a father. Um… I love my son! I love my son the same way that I love cigarettes. I like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, I’m thinking about how he’s fucking killing me. He’s a good little boy. No, he’s a great little fella. I really like him. Um… My girlfriend super loves him, though. It’s fucking creepy. And… I’m glad I have a son. That worked out good for me. I wouldn’t be a good father to a girl. It wouldn’t be good for me. Nothing weird. Wouldn’t fuck it. I… I just don’t get along with women. You know how it is. I don’t want them in my house, and… So… Because you dream, see… For example, okay? When Hank was born… the couple over the road, within two weeks of Hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was… “Aw, that’s great. I hope Hank fucks that one day.” That’s what I think… ‘Cause that’s what I think about my son. I hope when he’s of age, he just fucks everything. I don’t care if my son is gay or straight. All I care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. That is my dream for my son! [Audience cheering] But never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, “Oh, I hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. I hope you’re never shy of a cock. I hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.” Right, you know… And it’s not just me. Women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. My girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. I go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there’s a little daycare crèche thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there’s, like, three women in their 50s. They’re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. Then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. And there’s a woman that works there who just loves my son. She sees all the other kids, but she loves Hank, and Hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. And it’s super cute, I bring Hank up the stairs, and he starts going, “Uh, uh!” Trying to reach at her, all right? And she does this, she goes, “Everyone, my boyfriend’s here. Here’s my boyfriend. Give him here. He’s my boyfriend.” And then she kisses him, and she goes, ♪ My boyfriend gives me kisses My boyfriend gives me kisses ♪ It’s fucking adorable. But I tried doing that with a baby girl… Let’s say you go to the gym and there’s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. “Hey, everyone… me girlfriend’s here. Give her here. Give her here. She’s my girlfriend. My girlfriend gives me kisses. You know that, right? She’s always giving me kisses. Enjoy your workout. Don’t worry about a thing.” [Applause] [Cheering] So… Also… it’s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. It’s just little things. Even when they’re babies, it’s just easier. There’s a wiping technique when you’re wiping a baby’s ass. I don’t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. The baby lays on its back. You put their feet together. You lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. With a boy, you can wipe like that. Up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? With a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. Downward and away. It’s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. Very important. ‘Cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. They do. They fucking hate it. Boys don’t give a shit. Fucking… My son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and I’ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he’ll be laughing like it’s the best day ever. Even at my age now, I find it funny if I have shit on my dick. If I fuck my girlfriend in the ass, I pull out, I’ve got shit on my dick, I’ll ring me mate Jason up and go, “Hey, Jason… It’s happened again. I got shit on my dick.” And he’ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we’ll laugh and laugh and laugh. But never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she’s thought, “Oh, I can’t wait to call Karen.” [Chuckles] [Laughs] When you… When my girlfriend got pregnant… When you meet… When you haven’t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. Whenever you meet couples with children they’re always like',\n",
       "  ', “It is the most fulfilling thing I’ve ever done with my life. My heart grows larger and larger every day.” And then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, “You’re never gonna sleep again! [Laughs maniacally] Forget about it. It’s over. You’re not gonna sleep.” They’re constantly telling you you’re not gonna sleep. Raising a baby is not that hard. I’ll tell you what, it’s easier than a coke habit. I had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! At least it’s not me who wakes up crying anymore! I can sleep through other people crying. I’ve had girlfriends. That’s like white noise to me. I find it soothing. See, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, “Fuck it! Let’s have a kid.” Fucking did it, right? These other people, man… You know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, “We’re getting engaged. You wanna come to the party?” And you wanna say, “No, you’re really boring and we hate you.” But you go, “Oh, okay, great. You’re still together, are you? You fucked one person, have you? Oh, how exciting.” And… And then what they do is they don’t have a kid right away because they’re still not ready. “We have to see how our careers are going and shit.” And what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog’s their baby. They refer to it as their fucking baby. They send you a Christmas card of them holding the dog… and it says, “From our family to yours.” And then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? Then they come over. This fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you’re like, “What the fuck is this shit?” And they’re like, “We had to bring him. We bring our baby everywhere.” And you go, “Well, your baby is biting my actual baby. Can you control…” And then, eventually, they decide they’re gonna have a kid ’cause they’ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, “What’s happening? A new person.” And they’re like, “Fuck off. We don’t love you anymore. We’re going.” And they think they’ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven’t learnt anything. What happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the dog dies? You go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog… try to pass it off as the same dog. What happens if your girlfriend’s away on work and the baby dies? Very hard… to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. Easier if you’re black or Asian. [Audience cheering] Boston, no! No! No! Shut up! I will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? I’m not saying ’cause they look the same. I’m saying ’cause they’re easier to purchase. [Audience cheering] [Audience whooping] If Angelina Jolie and Madonna have taught us anything… it is that you can buy black and Asian people. I’m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from Norway with a child, going… “Yolanda, quick, get Hans. Bring him over. Come on.” [Jeffries chuckles]\\nI’m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. Uh… Gun control. Now… No, wait. Before you… Don’t get excited because the other people have guns. The anti-gun people are like, “Yeah! Do it, Jim!” No, let’s just… [Shushes] Now, before I start saying this, I wanna say this, right? I believe in your right as Americans to have guns. I’m not trying to stop you from having guns. All I’m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. My opinion on the… Oh, it doesn’t matter. I don’t like guns, right? I’m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? In Australia, we had guns, right? Right up until 1996. In 1996, Australia had the biggest massacre on Earth. It still hasn’t been beaten. And… Now, after that, they banned the guns. Now, in the 10 years before Port Arthur, there was 10 massacres. Since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn’t been a single massacre since. I don’t know how or why this happened, uh… Maybe it was a coincidence, right? Now, please understand that I understand that Australia and America are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? I get it. In Australia, we had the biggest massacre on Earth, and the Australian government went, “That’s it! No more guns!” And we all went, “Yeah, all right, then. That seems fair enough, really.” Now, in America, you had the Sandy Hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, “Maybe… we’ll get rid of the big guns?” And 50% of you went, “Fuck you! Don’t take my guns!” [Whooping] So, here’s where it gets confusing, right? Now, as I said, I am all for your Second Amendment rights. I think you should be able to have guns. It’s in your constitution. What I am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. There is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument… “Fuck off. I like guns.” It’s not the best argument, but it’s all you’ve got. And there’s nothing wrong with it. There’s nothing wrong with saying, “I like something. Don’t take it away from me.” But don’t give me this other bullshit. The main one is, [In American accent] “I need it for protection. I need to protect me. I need to protect my family.” Really? Is that why they’re called “assault rifles”? Is it? I’ve never heard of these fucking “protection rifles” you speak of. Protection? What the fuck are you talking about? You have a gun in your house, you’re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. And people think, “Well, that’d never happen to me.” You don’t know that, because you know what?\\n♪ From time to time We all get sad ♪ \\n♪ One day you’re happy Then you’re sad ♪ \\n♪ And then, uh-oh ♪\\nProtection. I had a break-in in Manchester, England, where I was tied up, I had my head cut. They threatened to rape my girlfriend. They came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and Americans always go, [In American accent] “Well, imagine if you had a gun.” And I’m like, “All right. I was naked at the time. I wasn’t wearing my holster. I wasn’t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come t',\n",
       "  \"hrough.” What world do you live in where you’re constantly fucking ready? You have guns ’cause you like guns! That’s why you go to gun conventions! That’s why you read gun magazines! None of you give a shit about home security. None of you go to home security conventions. None of you read Padlock Monthly. None of you have a Facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, “Fucking yeah!” Like you’re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. You have it at all fucking times. By the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking TV! You think that people are coming to murder your family? How many fucking enemies do you have? Jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone’s coming to murder you. See, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. You have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it’s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. Happens every fucking day, but people go, “That’d never happen in my house ’cause I’m a responsible gun owner. I keep my guns locked in a safe.” Then they’re no fucking protection! Someone comes into the house, you’re like, “Wait there, fuck-face! Oh! You’ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. I tell you what. I’m gonna fuck you up! Okay. Is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? Your mother’s birthday? Why the fuck would I know your fucking mother’s birthday? Maybe if you didn’t leave the window open [In whining voice] ‘because it’s too hot in here,’ we wouldn’t be getting fucking murdered, right?” I find the NRA to be hard work. The fact that they always think the answer is more guns. After Sandy Hook happened, the NRA said, and I quote, “None of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.” I… I think they’re forgetting what school was like. Does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to… Whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [Chuckling] “Oh, we’re gonna make her cry.” And then she’d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you’d go, “You’re never getting married, are you, Miss? Never gonna happen for you.” Then she’d get back to her 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and she’d be crying over the steering wheel, just, “Why don’t they like me?” Let’s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [Audience cheering] And then they go, “Oh, well, answer to that, we’ll just add more guns.” They go, “We’ll put an armed security guard at every school across America.” Yeah, that’ll work out. The average security guard in America earns $16 an hour. Not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! Someone comes onto the school and… [Mimicking machine gun] And you’ve got Kevin. Now, I’m sure Kevin’s shit-hot at Call of Duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I understand that when I’m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don’t agree with me, and I do respect the people who don’t agree with me. Don’t think I don’t. Out of the 50% that don’t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it’s not to be taken seriously, and they’re laughing along ’cause it’s just funny jokes, right? And then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. They’re looking around, going, “Wonder how they got that chandelier up there?” And then… there’s the last 10%. And they’re fucking furious. Right now, in this room and the people watching at home… 10% of you are fucking seething. Just… And for a couple of reasons. First reason, I’m making good points. [Audience cheering] Second reason. Second reason. Second reason, and this is the big one, I’m foreign… and that’s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can’t fucking turn it off, and it’s just going around in a circle, and you’re just going, “If you don’t like it, go home! If you don’t like it, go home!” And my answer to that is, “No.” I came here legally. I pay my taxes. I’ll say whatever the fuck I want. Your First Amendment means that I can say the Second Amendment sucks dicks. And… unless you’re an American Indian, you’re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. People get so precious about it. I understand that to Americans, your constitution is very important. I respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. It’s no more special than any other constitution. We have one in Australia. I don’t know what it says. I’ve never seen it. If there’s a problem, we’ll check it, but everything’s going fine. And don’t get me wrong. I get that the constitution is important to you. I have had… Fucking, I get it, right? I’ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as I’m leaving the theater, going, [In American accent] “You cannot change the Second Amendment!” And I’m like, “Yes, you can. It’s called an ‘amendment.'” If you can’t change something that’s called an “amendment”, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. And if you don’t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. Don’t think your constitution is set in stone. You’ve changed things before. You used to have prohibition in there, right? And then people were like, “Hey, who likes getting fucked up? Yeah, I like getting fucked up, too. Let’s get that one out. Let’s get that one out.” You used to have this other thing in America called, uh… slavery! And then Lincoln came along and went, “That’s it. No more slaves!” And 50% of you went, “Fuck you! Don’t take my slaves!” And the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. “Why should I have my slaves taken off me? I’m a responsible slave owner. I’m trained in how to use my slaves safely. Just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn’t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. I… I use my slaves to protect my family! I keep my slaves locked in a safe!” That’s the thing. “Why should I have my guns taken off me? I’ve done nothing wrong.” Look, I agree with you. If you’re a responsible gun owner and you don’t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. You really sh\",\n",
       "  'ould. But that’s not how society works. We have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. We have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? I take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [Audience cheering] We should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can’t, can we? Because Sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. Oh! “Oh, thanks, Sarah. You fucked it up for everyone.” Right? Everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? But we can’t because Jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. “Thanks, Jonathan! Now I have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!” See, that’s the thing. “Why should I have my guns taken off me, I’m responsible, just because that guy’s crazy?” Who’s to say you’re not crazy? That’s the thing about crazy people. They don’t know they’re crazy. That’s what makes them crazy. The only thing you know for sure on this Earth is, “I think, therefore I am.” You know that you exist. Anything past that is open to interpretation, right? You know you exist and that’s it. Right now, I think I’m in Boston talking to 1,200 people. That’s what I think I’m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that I’m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [Slurring speech] “I hate guns. I hate guns. I hate guns.” [Audience applauding] See, one of the better arguments is, “Well, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.” Not true. When they banned the guns in Australia, it worked. When they banned them in Britain, it worked, okay? The Bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook costs, like, $1,000 American and you can buy it in Walmart. It’ll be delivered to your house. That’s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? That same gun in Australia on the black market costs $34,000. Now if you have $34,000, you don’t need to be a criminal. You’ve got $34,000. You’re a great little saver. Keep going. So that covers the criminals, but that doesn’t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. It kind of does. The people who do the massacres, it covers them ’cause they go… The kid at Colorado who thought he was The Joker, let’s say that he had some social issues. The kid at Sandy Hook was Asperger’s as fuck. Right? I don’t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can’t just rock up at the docks going, [Slurring speech] “Guns! Who wants to sell me a gun?” Now, I’m gonna wrap this up. We won’t talk about it anymore. Now… See, the one thing that I do really agree with with the right to bear arms, I really agree with… That the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. In case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that’s why it was written. – [Audience cheering] – Yeah! And that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. But you do know the government has drones, right? You get that? You’re bringing guns to a drone fight! If we went back to muskets, I’m all for it! Keep the Second Amendment. If we all have muskets… Muskets are awesome! Every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. You know what’s good about the musket? It gives you a lot of time to calm down. Someone calls your wife fat, and you’re like, “Fuck you, buddy! Ah, you’re not a bad guy. You’re all right.”\\nNow… after the show, we’re gonna go out, have a big party around Boston, see how it goes. I’m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. My girlfriend has said that’s a no… ’cause I don’t behave myself in there, so I’m not allowed to go to them anymore. ‘Cause strip clubs aren’t what women think they are. [Stammers] It used to be like… Okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it’s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. That’s what men want to see. Women, when they go to their Magic Mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are… women wanna see a guy, “Hey, ladies. He’s a fireman.” And he comes out with his hose and like that… And whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they’ve still got the fireman’s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman’s gun on a holster, right? Because even when a man’s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. When men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job’s stripping. We want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go… “You can’t take care of your kids.” It’s… And when men get private dances in these strip clubs, I don’t know… I don’t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it’s dry humping. There’s no dancing. The girl gets in front. She gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it… and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go… That’s what a private “dance” is, right? I don’t know if there’s private dancing in female strip clubs. [Stammering] I can’t imagine that there would be. I don’t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going… She goes, “How was it?” And she goes, “Well… he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals… and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. I got to go to the ATM.”\\nSo Legit got canceled. [Audience booing] Yeah. I know. I know it. Who would’ve thought it would’ve struggled on that great FXX channel that everyone knew about? The first season is on Netflix. This special is being recorded for Netflix. So you can go watch it there if you’re watching the special. It was… I’m very proud of it. We had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didn’t… Now… The whole TV show is based around one standup routine that I used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that I took to a brothel, which is a true story. And so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who… In the end, we used DJ Qualls, and DJ Qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie Road Trip. He’s the skinny white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow, and he’s the white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow. Now… the great t',\n",
       "  'hing about DJ is… he already looks disabled. He has that “latter stages of AIDS” thing going on. It’s great for casting. Anyway, but… I didn’t want DJ to begin with. I wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the Actors’ Union of America said, “You cannot do that.” Because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, I think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. And I said, “All right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?” And they sent me a list. And on this list, I said, “Can you get rid of all the contagious ones? And what have we got left?” So I saw every disabled actor in Hollywood, and I’ll be honest with you, not that many of them. I don’t know why. Maybe they’re just lazy. They don’t wanna work. Maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. And none of them were very good, either. Everyone we saw, none of them were very good ’cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. None of them knew what to do with their hands, and… they all came in. Until this one guy came in. I had seen a lot of people that day. This guy was the most disabled person I’d ever seen in my life. He was like… Think of the most disabled person you’ve seen, then double it. …really super disabled. He was shaped like a pretzel. He was being carried in by this big Russian nurse, carried him in. He made that great disabled sound of… [Groans] That one. I just loved him. Anyway… so he comes in for the audition… and I’m sitting there, and we’re doing the lines together, and at first, I didn’t know if he was mentally all there either, so I was being a little bit patronizing. I was going, “Thank you so much for coming in.” And then we did the dialog together, and I didn’t have to worry about a thing. This kid was funny. He was smart. His timing was impeccable. I thought he was just great, and I helped him out of the room, and I come back to the director and I said, “That’s our guy. That’s who we gotta pick.” And he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. So the next bloke wheels himself in. Now, obviously, he’s just a paraplegic if he’s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn’t really suit me because… paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. But I thought… “If he’s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.” So he comes in… He comes in, I shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. And I went, “Whoa! What’s going on there, kicky?” And he goes… “Oh, you got me! I’m not disabled.” And I said, “You’re fucking what now?” And he goes, “I’m not disabled. I just really wanted the role, so I rented a wheelchair.” And I said, “Just shut up. So let me… This is how your day has mapped-out thus far. You woke up this morning. You drove to the wheelchair rental place. You rented a wheelchair. You carried it out, I assume. You put it in the trunk of your car. You drove here. You got the wheelchair out. You carried it up three flights of stairs. You went to the waiting room. You put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. Then you sat in it and practiced your lines.” And he went… “Yeah.” And I said, “You’re a fucking asshole, mate. Get the fuck out of here.” And I kicked him out. And later on that day, I’m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors I’m gonna call to tell them they’ve got parts, and I’m holding this disabled guy’s headshot, and I just think, “I’m gonna call this guy up. I’m gonna change his life. This is an awesome moment, right?” And I’m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. He looked really like… And I thought, “This has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.” The shutter on his camera has gotta be like… [Mimicking camera shutter] Like… [Audience applauding] And then I read the guy’s biography… and then it dawned on me. “This guy’s not disabled either! I hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! This cunt rented a nurse!” Do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? I’m all for a method actor. Get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, “Ta-da!” And we would have gone, “That was very good.” But I’ll tell you what you don’t do. Don’t make me carry you to your car! I carried him down three flights of stairs going, “You did very good.” He’s like, “Thank you, Jim.” [Laughing]\\n[Chuckles] I was, uh… I go to a therapist… ’cause I get depressed. So I got a therapist every now and again. I literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, “I’m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.” Like just out of the movies, right? And she went, “Red,” and I went, “Blue.” And then she went, “Cooking,” and I went, “Food,” and all that type of stuff. We went like this forever. And then she went… For the last question, she went, “And what’s your favorite thing in the world?” And I went… “Coming on a girl’s face.” Now… Now, I could’ve said things like… “Ice cream” is a good answer. “Hank” would’ve been an excellent answer. But I said, “Coming on a girl’s face.” And I’ve had six months to think about my answer, and I stand by it. – I… – [Cheering] I’m not proud of it. I hate myself for thinking it. It’s such a horrible thing to do to another human. When a girl’s on her knees and you… It’s so… And as an atheist, I believe in Darwin and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. There was never a bit in his book where he went, “When a caveman loves a cavewoman, he’ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won’t come near.” There was never that… never that moment. But, by golly, if it’s not fun. I find it… To… Look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may I say, “Bravo!” Don’t… don’t think what you do… has gone unnoticed. We notice. We appreciate your work. I think you deserve a parade of some kind. During Memorial Day, after the Vietnam vets, before the First Gulf War guys, w',\n",
       "  'e could bring in, “And here’s the women who take a load on their face.” And you could march out, and married men would stand there going, “God bless you, ladies.” [Audience cheering] I enjoy your acting that you do. The standard tongue out and the… Like that… I don’t know why, but I enjoy… I know it’s a lie. I know you’re not excited, but I still appreciate the effort is what I enjoy. I love the look because it’s such a, “Oh, jeez, I’m excited, too. When this come hits my face, there’s a good chance I’ll also orgasm. Anything could happen in this crazy world.” But this is what redeems us as men. This is what redeems us. Just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. The next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [Men whooping] I go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on Earth. I’m like, “You fucking slut… Oh, I love you. Ah… Uh, all right. No, no, no. Put your tongue back in. Um… Keep your eyes shut. Just keep them shut. Uh… All right, I’m going to get a towel. I’ll get a towel. I’ll get you a towel. All right. You’re a wonderful mother to our child.” [Laughs] [Audience cheering] See… this is what kills me. My son will one day watch this DVD. And I’m the guy who’s meant to teach him right from wrong, and I’m there wiping come off his mother’s face.\\nI think I did something illegal with my son the other day. I think it might be illegal. Tell me if this is illegal. All right? I’m in the shower. My girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, I was in the shower, and Hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, “Argh!” Like that. And I went… [Vocalizing] And I saw his little face and I went, “Hello, Hankie.” And then in the condensation, I drew a little bowtie on him… and a little suit… and then I gave him a voice bubble that said, “I love my daddy. Love, Hank.” But I did it so I could read it. Well, of course he could read the “K,” and… then I stepped out. I stepped out of the bathroom and I went, “G’day, Hankie!” And he slapped my cock and he ran off. Now, is that illegal? I don’t know. Is it illegal because, A, a child touched my cock, or because, B, I found it really funny and I’ve been telling everyone. And I can’t get angry at him because his whole life, he’s been lying on mats with things dangling over. He’s been training for this his entire life.\\nI think I’ve, uh… I think I’ve become American, more American than I am Australian lately, and there was a moment where I tipped over where I went, “Oh, I think like an American person now.” And I’m happy to do it. I just… I’ll tell you what happened. I was flying around… I was doing a tour of Australia, and I was flying domestically around Australia, and I’m so used to airports and stuff here in America that… Okay, what happens is, when you go… I was flying Sydney to Melbourne. When you fly domestically in Australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there’s a conveyor belt underneath. You throw your bag on. Bag fucks off. You don’t speak to anyone. Then I go up to the gate bit, and the lady’s going, “Tickets, please.” And I’m holding my ID out like a fucking simpleton. ‘Cause I get through airports quick, man. I’m like, “Fucking there you go.” And she went, “Put your ID away. I don’t need to see that.” And I went… “I think you do.” And she went, “I don’t… Why would I need to see your ID?” And I said, “I might be a terrorist.” And she went, “Would showing me your ID stop you from blowing the plane up?” “No, I’d probably still blow the plane up.” So then I get up to the TSA conveyor belt thing, and I’m so good at the airports. I’m already taking my shoes off as I’m walking, right? And all the Australians behind me assume that I’m American, and they’re losing their fucking shit. They’re like, “Oh, for fuck’s sake! One of these cunts, eh?” And the TSA guy goes, “Hey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?” And I went… [Shouting] “I don’t know! Maybe they’re bombs?” And he went… “But they’re not, are they?” I put me shoes back on. I get my laptop out. Everyone’s going mental. And the TSA guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, “Jeez, mate. That’s a nice computer. Why are you showing it to everyone?” “It might also be a bomb.” And then the guy said the most Australian thing I’ve ever heard come out of anyone’s mouth ever. He went… “Oh, come on, mate. You wouldn’t have two bombs.” [Audience laughing] [Chuckles] I’m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense.\\nAll right. Oscar Pistorius. If you haven’t been following the case, you’re missing out. This is the greatest thing since OJ Simpson. You’re fucking missing out, mate. If you don’t know who Oscar Pistorius is, let me fill you in. Oscar Pistorius is a legless man from South Africa, known as the Blade Runner. He ran in two Olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied Olympics in one year. No one has ever done that. He’s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on Valentine’s Day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on Earth… and that’s when he became an inspiration to me… ’cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long. Let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. You can’t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [Mock tearfully] People have feelings, you cunts. Now, there’s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. One of the theories is that they found in her phone… He went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a South African rugby player on Valentine’s Day, right? Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever been to South Africa, but in South Africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. It goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. Legless running’s their second sport. You wouldn’t have thought that. Anyway… I’m going to reenact what I believe happened that day. To do that, I will now be doing a South African accent. No',\n",
       "  'w I know, many of you can’t tell the difference between my accent and a South African accent. Here’s the difference. Picture my accent, but I’m punching a black person. What I’m trying to say is South Africans are horrible people. So… she’s coming out of the shower. She’s been drying her hair. She’s listening to Rodriguez or something. She comes out. He’s laying on the bed. He looks up at her, he’s holding the phone, and he goes, [In South African accent] “What the fuck is this? I’ve been through your phone. You have been texting a rugby player.” And she’s like, “Oh! Fuck you! Who the fuck do you think you are?” “Who am I? I’m Oscar Pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. That’s who the fuck I am.” “Well, I would rather be with a rugby player. At least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.” – [Audience exclaiming] – I know. [Audience laughing] “Oh! Fuck you!” “No! Fuck you! I’m leaving you!” And then she storms out of the room, and then he was like… “You fucking bitch! [Grunts] I hate you! [Grunting] You will rue the day… that you left Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner! Don’t go anywhere! [Grunting] I hate you!” That’s where he keeps his legs. All right. Then he put the blades on. “Oh, you’re in trouble, missy. I tell you. I go to my gun safe.” She locked herself in the bathroom. He shot her through the bathroom door. Seems like overkill, doesn’t it? Bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but Oscar’s one of the few men on Earth that couldn’t kick the door in, right? He was wearing the blades, so… Boing! Ah! So… I think Oscar will probably go to prison. Now… in South Africa, one in four people have AIDS. I assume it may even be worse in the prison population. Now, can I say this? Look… I’ve never raped a man. I hate that I have to put “a man” in that sentence, but whatever. I’ve never raped a man, but… if I was going to rape a man, it would be a legless Olympian… ’cause in prison, it’s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you’re tough and all that. Like, “You want to fucking rape me? I just raped an Olympian, bitch. Is that what you fucking want?” There’d be a wonderful moment… when you’re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a Terminator movie. [Chuckling] You know what I like about that joke? So often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. Not in that one. He’s the hero.\\nAll right, we have to get going soon. Before I leave, – I thank you very much for coming. – [Audience groaning] No, I said, “soon,” not “over.” It’s just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [Chuckles] [Man whistles] I always… I always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. What do they think is going to happen? Like, I’m going to go, “Fucking you know me, mate. I was enjoying claps and cheers, but what I needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. Thank God you came along to pick up my spirits.” [Man] Love you! All right, final story. Now, I was in South Africa again. Jeez, I don’t think I’ll be working in South Africa after this special comes out. I used to do, like, one tour in South Africa every year, and I just don’t know if I’ll be invited this time. They’ll be like, [In South African accent] “We don’t like him. He’s no good.” Anyway, so, I’m in South Africa, and I had to fly back from Cape Town to Los Angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. You’ve to go up to London and go across. Cunt of a trip. Um… But it was all right ’cause I had a business class ticket, so I didn’t give a fuck. And when I travel economy, I try to dress up nice ’cause I like to look good in case someone recognizes me and I might get an upgrade. But when I’ve already got a business class ticket, I try to look like a bag of shit… ’cause it’s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn’t want me there and they’re annoyed by my presence. So… I’m wearing a white T-shirt that’s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. I’m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. So, anyway, I go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and I go, “Hello,” and the lady goes, [In South African accent] “Oh, Mr. Jefferies, I’m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.” I said, “You what now?” She goes, “Business class is full. You have been downgraded.” And I said, “I understand that business class is full. I bought one of the tickets that made it full.” And she went, “I’m sorry, sir. There’s nothing I can do.” And then I just went, “Are you fucking kidding me?” Now, you know when you’re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, ’cause as soon as you swear, they don’t have to engage with you anymore. They can act like they’re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? So I went, “Are you fucking kidding me?” And she went, “Please do not speak to me that way! I have done nothing wrong!” And I said, “Are you, a white South African, telling me you’ve done nothing wrong?” Anyway… tensions rose. The manager comes over. Big fat cunt called Simon Fulcher, right? He walks over and goes, [In South African accent] “What is wrong here? What is wrong?” And I said, “I bought a business class ticket and I want a business class ticket.” And he goes, “What do you want me to do? Make a new chair for you? There are no more seats. I can’t do anything.” He goes, “I’ll tell you what I can do. Go up to the executive lounge. Have some peanuts. Enjoy a beverage. Listen to Rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. So I thought, “There’s nothing I can do.” So I walk off with my ticket. I’m walking through the airport like, “Fucking British Airways, bunch of fucking cunts.” Right? I get up to the counter. And the woman behind the counter said, “Tickets, please.” And I hand over my ticket and she goes, [In South African accent] “I’m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. Your ticket says ‘economy’ on it.” And I said… [Inhales sharply] “I bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded…” And as I was doing my little speech, she looked past me an',\n",
       "  'd went, “Next.” [Audience exclaiming] “Listen here, you fucking cunt.” [Audience laughing] All right? Now, you say “cunt” in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. Security came from everywhere. I was going, “Don’t you fucking come near me, cunt!” And I said, “I want to speak to Simon Fulcher,” like I’m… And they go, “All right.” They ring the manager up, and then they go… He goes, “Is it the pale Australian man?” And the guy went, “Yes.” He goes, “We’ve had problems with him. Let him through.” Right? So I go through. I’m sitting there, I’m eating my peanuts. And I’m just angry now, going, “Fucking British Airways. Fucking cunts, fucking…” Like that. And in walks in a group of Americans, about 30 of them. You know the type, right? They all… And whenever I see Americans abroad… I’ll do my impersonation of any American abroad. When Americans are abroad, you’re just pointing out shit you see. You’re just walking around going, [In American accent] “Oh, this is great! Look at that. That’s a chair right there. Okay. Oh, what’s that over there? Okay. Wonderful. Great.” Right? And this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [In American accent] “Did anyone else see that Australian guy speaking to that lady out there? Some people have no class.” And I put my head around the pylon, and I went, “You can fuck off and all! You don’t know what I’ve been through! I’ve been downgraded!” And as I said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that I was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. None of us are getting promoted. They all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. It was like a scene out of Braveheart, and they all stood up and went, “Fucking downgraded!” And the woman in the group was doing this, “Don’t speak to me that way. Who the hell do you think you are?” And all the men in the group were like, “Hey, why don’t you shut the fuck up? Just shut the fuck up.” ♪ It doesn’t matter These people seem very angry, so ♪ And a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. And, sometimes, Americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. And he came up and he went, [In American accent] “Hey. Hey. Yeah, I get it. [Exhales sharply] Downgraded, yeah. That really grinds my gears, I tell you that. Yeah, I would write a strongly-worded letter. I really would.” And then I thought, at least this guy’s being nice, and I said, “Look, mate, don’t worry about it. It’s not like it’s your fault.” And I said, “Why are you in such a big group anyway?” And he goes, “Oh, we’re in Neil Diamond’s band. That’s Neil Diamond’s backup singer you just called a cunt there.” And as he said that, Neil Diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero… and I reacted like he was one. I went, “Neil Diamond!” And Neil Diamond went, [In husky voice] “Hey, what’s going on?” And then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe Neil Diamond could solve problems. And I went, “Neil! Me and all these people, we’ve been downgraded!” And Neil went, “Oh! Oh, right. Uh, well, maybe that’s our fault. We decided to come back a day early.” “You can fuck off and all, Neil Diamond!” And then a fight breaks out amongst the Neil Diamond band and the downgraded. Punches are thrown. Not by me. I don’t know if you have the Internet, but I’m not much of a fighter. I’m an excellent scurrier-awayer. I get down. “Hey, what have you got there? Hiya!” Anyway, the airport police came. Three people were arrested from the downgraded… but three people were arrested from the Neil Diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class. [Audience cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Good night. Appreciate it. [Audience cheering] [Upbeat music playing] Thank you. Go home. Let’s have a drink.

Let’s fucking do this.\\n[audience cheers]\\nI bought my girlfriend a bath bomb. I say that… toaster.\\n[audience laughs]\\nShe was shocked.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWhen my girlfriend found out I’d been drunk driving, she hit the roof.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI was in Hong Kong. Their Chinatown is fucking massive.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’ve got a half-brother. Sorry. Transgender.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience applauds and cheers]\\nIt’s a cliché, I suppose, but I… I… I, um…\\nI used to tell jokes at school to stop kids from bullying me. They used to shout mean things like, “Get out of our playground, you pedophile!”\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’ve got feelings. My art teacher at school was a pedophile. Yeah, so it really was back to the drawing board.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI write a lot of my jokes on my iPhone, but the autocorrect is always fucking up the lunch line.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAh…\\n[scattered applause]\\nSure.\\n[audience applauds]\\nEveryone in here’s got a mobile phone, right?\\n[audience agrees]\\nAnd they’re incredible. They’ve done so much for us. But it has come at a price. They’ve robbed us of our ability to concentrate, those mobile phones, yeah? A good example. Last week, I had to do a simple piece of mental arithmetic. ‘Course, I couldn’t do it in my head, needed the app on the phone. Before I’d even opened the calculator app, I checked my email, updated my Instagram, and hit a cyclist.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAre you aware of the mobile phone secretly listening to your conversation?\\n[audience] Yes.\\nIt’s creepy, right? You’ll be chatting to a friend about the good old days, and then for the next two weeks, you’re bombarded with adverts for anal beads and butt plugs.\\n[audience laughs]\\nMy, uh… My girlfriend likes to be tied up. [chuckles] But, it turns out, really scared of railway tracks.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWhen I masturbate, thanks for asking…\\n[audience laughs]\\nWhen I masturbate, I always put my pinky up so it looks like a fancy lady is, uh…\\n[audience chuckles]\\n…fingering my asshole.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThere’s a sub-genre of porn called POV porn, which is shot from the man’s perspective, so you see what the man sees when he’s having sex with the lovely lady in the pornographic film. I’m gonna make POV porn, little money-making scheme, and make POV porn, but from the woman’s perspective. Huh? It’s gonna be super easy to shoot as well. It’s just a close-up of a headboard, a pillow, a ceiling, and some dude’s feet.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWell, ’cause people say men have got… are more sort of visual than women. Well, I don’t think so. I think we just have a better view, right?\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\n\\n\\nThink about it. There’s a bit of reverse cowgirl going on. We’re thinking, “Her ass looks amazing.” She’s thinking, “He needs to clip his toenails.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nIt’s not as erotically charged, is it?\\nDo any couples in here watch porn together? Who watches porn as a couple?\\n[man] Yeah.\\nOne bloke on his own.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience applauds and cheers]\\nAre you… You’re watching enough for two, are you?\\n[audience laughs]\\n[Jimmy laughs]\\nWe tried… We tried watching porn as a couple, but it didn’t work for us at all. Very different tastes. She likes stuff with proper narrative and characterization. I like stuff with animals.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI was watching Gaping Anuses 3…\\n[audience laughs]\\nPlanet of the Gapes. And sure, I enjoyed it, but there were some pretty big holes in the plot.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis next joke is sort of a canary in the mine. It’s there to test the air. Your reaction to this joke tells me an awful lot about you as an audience. Doesn’t change anything. I’m gonna tell you the same jokes this evening regardless of your reaction. It just tells me how much you’re gonna enjoy our time together.\\n[audience laughs mildly]\\nGood luck.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI was in a grocery store a couple of weeks ago.\\nThey had a special on.\\nHe was collecting the carts.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[scattered groaning]\\nI think we’re going to be friends, aren’t we?\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience applauds and cheers]\\nAnd no, no disrespect.\\nOne of my best friends is a special needs teacher. Well',\n",
       "  ', I say he’s a special needs teacher. It’s a totally normal school, but it’s in Norfolk, so, you know.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIs anyone in from Norfolk?\\n[scattered people] Yeah.\\n[man yells] Yeah.\\nYou’re from Norfolk? Oh!\\nYeah, that checks out.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIf you’re not familiar, uh, Norfolk’s…\\nSo, what are you working with there, my friend?\\nJust the one set of grandparents?\\n[audience laughs]\\n[scattered groans]\\nFamily tree like a fucking broom handle.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou didn’t meet the missus on Tinder, did you?\\nWhat was it, ancestry.com?\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat’s giving you the benefit of the doubt.\\nIt may well be “siblings with benefits.”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughs and groans]\\nToo close to home?\\n[audience laughs]\\nHe’ll be livid when he gets those jokes.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nMy girlfriend snores quite a lot. Has anyone else got that problem?\\n[audience] Yes.\\nYeah, my girlfriend snores quite a lot, but luckily, I’ve got these noise-cancelling fists.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIs anyone here in a controlling relationship?\\nRaise your partner’s hand.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[Jimmy laughs]\\nI’m no good with ages, especially with young women. They could be mid-20s. They could be 15. You just don’t know.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nWell, there’s a story. So I was in Covent Garden, very touristy bit of London. I’m sat on the Piazza there, having a cup of tea, minding my business. This beautiful, willowy-looking girl walks in, sits opposite me, and just keeps on looking over. Tons of eye contact, very flirty, and very obvious about it. Now, that sort of thing does not happen to me very often, so I was incredibly flattered, but I couldn’t tell how old she was, and I thought, “Well, I’m not taking a chance.” So I asked.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI just straight-up asked. I said, “Excuse me, do you mind me asking, how old are you?”\\nShe said, “I’m 23.”\\nI said, “I’m sorry for wasting your time.”\\n[audience laughs and groans]\\n[audience applauds]\\n[laughs]\\nAh, it’s just a joke, as far as any of you can prove.\\n[audience laughs]\\nLast year, I lost my father to dementia. I guess we could’ve stuck around to look for him for longer, but fuck it.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThe great thing about that, anyone offended won’t remember.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’ve written a two-word joke, and I’m quite pleased with this ’cause I’ve written a joke for an unsung group within our society, a group that I don’t think gets the respect that they deserve. Stepdads. We got any stepdads in?\\n[man cheers]\\nOh, you’re a stepdad here? What’s your name, my friend?\\nDaniel.\\nDaniel. I’ve written you a joke, Daniel. Won’t take long. It’s only two words. Stepdads… motherfuckers.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[applauding and cheering]\\nEasy.\\nAnd Daniel… no one is telling you how to parent. I’m sure you do a terrific job as-is. All I would say is, the next time you see the kids, could be as soon as tomorrow morning, you, you know, point out the obvious to them. You say, “Look, kids, ‘stepdad’ is an inherently disrespectful term. From here on in, ‘motherfucker.’ “\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Now, finish your Cocoa Puffs. I’m just gonna nip upstairs and fuck your mum.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nIs this the MILF in question?\\n[audience laughs]\\nVery nice. Came with a bit of baggage, you couldn’t give a fuck. Good on you.\\n[audience laughs]\\nHow many socks have you got, Daniel? Are you not familiar with the term? Socks. Some Other Cunt’s Kids.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\n[Jimmy laughs]\\n\\n\\n\\n[laughs]\\nClimate change. Let’s talk about it. Climate change is like my niece. It’s getting hotter every year.\\n[audience laughs and groans]\\nIt’s not as bad as you think. She’ll be six next month.\\n[audience groans]\\nI don’t even like the term “niece.” I prefer to say, “NILF.”\\n[audience groans]\\nMy girlfriend is vegan. Sorry, don’t know why I’m telling you that. I assume she’s already told you.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAre there any vegans here? Got vegans in the house?\\n[woman] Hey!\\nOne over there. What’s your name, my vegan friend?\\nErica.\\nErica? Very nice to have you here, Erica. I’m not… I’m not gonna make jokes about vegan food. I think it would be tasteless.\\n[audience laughs]\\nBut I’ve got a question for you, Erica, ’cause my partner is vegan. She had a question about veganism. Maybe you could help. Uh, she wants to know is semen okay for vegans?\\n[audience laughs]\\nBecause if it isn’t, she’s gotta stop having tennis lessons.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWhat do you think, Erica?\\nI love semen!\\n[audience exclaims and laughs]\\nWell…\\n[audience applauds]\\nFair enough. Probably the only protein you’re getting.\\n[exclaims]\\n[audience laughs]\\nIt’s a great answer, Erica. It’s a great answer. Not the best answer I’ve ever had. Best answer I ever had, Erica, I was doing a gig in London, and this lady in the front row was vegan. I said, “Is semen okay for vegans?” And she went, “Human semen?”\\n[audience exclaims and laughs]\\nWhat the fuck? How would you even get to that? I know vegans are meant to love animals, but sounds like she really loves animals.\\n[audience laughs]\\nKnife crime. Huge problem in the UK. What can be done? Well, simple solution. Guns.\\n[audience laughs]\\nRight, there’s no knife crime in America, is there?\\n[audience chuckles]\\n[audience laughs]\\nHave we got any Americans in? Any Americans?\\n[people cheer]\\nA few over there. What’s your name, sir?\\n[man] Ken.\\nKen? Of course it is.\\n[audience laughs]\\nTotally',\n",
       "  ' smooth, is it?\\n[audience laughs]\\nGood on you, Ken. The Americans and the British, we’re… we’re divided by a common language. Right?\\nSo… So we would say, “Trousers” in Great Britain. Americans would say, “Pants.”\\nWe say, “Pavement.” The Americans would say, “Sidewalk.”\\nWe’d say, “Unarmed, don’t shoot!” They would say, “Oops.”\\n[audience laughs and exclaims]\\nI can see there’s two sides to the gun debate in America. Course there are. There’s two sides to the gun debate. Some Americans have legitimate reasons for wanting to own AR-15 assault rifles. Like, what if you want to murder a lot of children in a hurry?\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughs]\\nSo in America, the Supreme Court is stopping women from aborting fetuses. They don’t feel, they haven’t got hearts, they’re brainless, yet somehow, the Supreme Court are in charge.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nWhen my girlfriend got pregnant, sure, I thought about all the options. “Should I, you know, take care of the problem?” But then I thought, “Could I really take a human life?” Well, two, if you count the fetus.\\n[audience groans]\\nAbortion. Let’s talk about it, everyone. Well, I think we’d spend a lot more time talking about, thinking about, debating abortion if we all knew how close we had come.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWell, let’s do a social experiment in the theater this evening. Give me one of those little ripply applause if and only if your parents were under the age of 20 when they had you.\\nWhere are you?\\n[scattered applause]\\nOkay, so anyone applauding, you need to know there was a conversation.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd that conversation didn’t go Dad’s way.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[scattered applause]\\nAll right. Give me one of those if you’re the youngest of four.\\n[scattered applause]\\nWell, you need to know there was a conversation.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd that conversation didn’t go Dad’s way.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAll right, give me one of those if you have a ginger-haired mum.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[very scattered applause]\\nFar fewer of those.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd that’s ’cause sometimes, dads really put their fucking foot down.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughs]\\n[audience applauds]\\nAre there any anti-vaxxers in? Is anyone here anti-vax?\\n[person shouts]\\nOne person over there. Fair enough. A lot of you didn’t make it.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWhat’s your name, my friend?\\n[man] Rico.\\nRico. Yeah. Sure.\\n[audience laughs]\\nLet’s go with that, Rico. Here’s what I think we should do. You’re entitled to your opinion. Course you are! What I think we should do, we should have an opt-in, opt-out on the whole of Western medicine. Opt-in, opt-out. So you’re either with us, or you’re not. So no COVID vaccine? No problem, Rico. Good luck with the polio.\\n[audience laughs]\\nLet’s see how far you get on your little Kermit legs.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nRight. I feel pretty confident making that joke, because no cunt is getting polio these days.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nDo you know why, Rico?\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\n[laughs] Oh.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe anti-vax people online won’t like that. Course they’re not gonna take the vaccine. They can’t even take a fucking joke.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nThis next joke might get me canceled.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nCome on. Transgender people aren’t what they used to be.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[scattered cheers]\\nAnd really, there’s two issues. There’s trans, and there’s non-binary. And they often get conflated in our media, but they’re very separate issues. Trans and non-binary. So non-binary, that’s the one with the pronouns. So there’s now more pronouns than there ever used to be. There’s now ten pronouns. I’ll quickly go through it so we’re all on the same page. The ten pronouns are he, she, they, them, it, oh, gross, what, is, that?\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience applauds]\\n[scattered cheers]\\nAnd I’m very onboard. I will call you what you want to be called. I will treat you with respect always. But…\\n[audience chuckles]\\n…I’m also gonna make jokes about it.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nMy pronouns are “he he he”…\\n[audience laughs]\\n[chuckles] …because I identify as a comedian.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[Jimmy chuckles]\\nHere’s a question just for the ladies in the room. Who teaches you the towel thing?\\n[scattered laughs]\\nOh, you know what I’m talking about. Every woman in this room has an ability no man on Earth possesses. Every woman in here has the ability to make a perfect turban from a towel.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAny towel, any bathroom. I’ve traveled the world, and it’s the same toweling origami design wherever you roam. It’s quite the feat of engineering. It’s up in seconds. It’s there for the day if you want it.\\n[audience laughs]\\nNow, no man has ever even attempted such a thing. Well, that simple observation on gender difference, that, my friends, is how we’re going to sort the whole trans debate. You’re welcome.\\n[audience laughs]\\nSo if you have gender dysphoria, we’re gonna pop you in a shower.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nWhen you come out, we’re gonna throw you a towel. We’re gonna see how you do.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIf you make a perfect turban, the ladies’ changing room is this way.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIf you floss yourself…\\n[audience laughs and applauds]\\n…we have a few more questions.\\nObviously, I’m not being transphobic, because trans women are women. So, if anything, old-fashioned misogyny.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[Jim',\n",
       "  'my laughs]\\nI’m gonna tell you a fact now. It is mind-blowingly stupid, but it’s true. Most of my gay friends knew this. None of my straight friends knew. Okay, until 1979, globally, homosexuality was classified as a mental illness. An illness! Does that mean you could phone in sick?\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Sorry, boss. No, I can’t come in today. No, no, nothing like that. No. No, I can’t stop thinking about dicks and balls and bums.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Nah, it’s probably just a 24-hour thing. Yeah, I’ll… No.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“No, I’ll walk it off.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Yep, yep, in the park. Yeah.”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughs]\\nThey say one man in ten is gay, but surely one man in just one man is pretty gay.\\n[audience laughs]\\nOne man in ten is showboating.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI don’t like having sex outdoors, but that is where women walk at night.\\n[audience laughs and groans]\\nI used to share a house with a woman who swore a ghost was having sex with her in her dreams. I thought, “Jesus Christ! From now on, I gotta mash two pills into her food.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nOnly 15% of rapes are ever reported, and only 2% of those ever lead to a conviction. Now, I’m not advocating rape, but I like those odds.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAll I’m saying is if rape was a horse, you’d have a bet on it.\\n[audience laughs]\\nDo you want to hear my rape fantasy?\\n[man] Yeah!\\nSomeone goes to jail for rape.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience applauds]\\nIt’s… I mean, those are very clearly jokes about rape, but we don’t take rape serious enough as a society, as a culture. And I can prove it. It’s in our language. We’ve still got the phrase “date rape.” We shouldn’t be calling anything “date rape.” And we should be calling date rape, “rape.” That’s what fucking happened.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nI tell you, we wouldn’t stand for it if the vast majority of rapes happened to men, right? No other crime comes with a qualifier. You’ve never had this conversation…\\n“Did you hear about Steve?”\\n“What happened to Steve?”\\n“He got circus murdered.”\\n“Sorry, Steve got murdered?”\\n“Well, no. He had a lovely day at the circus, and then he was murdered. So, you know… circus murdered.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou can hear it now. “Date rape,” my ass.\\n[audience chuckles]\\n[audience laughs]\\nObviously, don’t.\\nWell, so far, we’ve covered rape, pornography, child abuse, domestic violence, abortion, murder, gun control, and trans issues. We’re right on schedule, everyone.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nYay. Obviously, telling jokes with that kind of subject matter, I’m gonna get canceled. That’s the bad news. The good news is I’m going down swinging.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou hear some horror stories about cancel culture. I heard a story about a woman in London last year. She got canceled. Lost her job, lost friends, lost status. Right? Canceled. And she was a good woman. She worked for a charity that helps the learning disabled, and she got canceled over a typo. Can you believe that? A typo. You know how the G and the T are right next to each other on the keyboard? Easy enough mistake to make. The G and the T are right there next to each other. Well, what she wanted to write at the end of the letter to the charity supporters was, “Kind regards.”\\n[audience laughs slowly]\\nNow if you’ve not got that yet…\\n[audience laughs]\\n…the charity she was working for was helping people like you.\\n[audience laughs and applauds]\\n[Jimmy laughs]\\nThis woke nonsense, it’s gone too far, hasn’t it? When’s it gonna stop? We’ve even got a male queen now.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThe last time I got canceled, I upset the gypsies. Thankfully, they’ve moved on.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou can’t go around apologizing for jokes. They’re jokes. So I’ve got a plan. The next time I get canceled over a joke, the next time I upset people with a joke, I’m going to come out on the day of the cancellation, I’m going to make a statement, a public statement. I’m going to say, I’ve rehearsed this, I’m gonna say… [sarcastically] “I’m sorry.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd the people that I’ve offended will say, “You don’t really mean that apology.”\\nAnd I’ll say, “So you’re saying I could say something and not mean it. Now you’re getting it.”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughs and applauds]\\nOf course, sometimes in life, and you’ll all know this, sometimes in life, you find yourself having to make an apology, but what you really want to say is, “Fuck you.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd there’s a phrase for that. “I’m sorry you feel that way.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nIt’s an amazing expression. “I’m sorry you feel that way” has got all the “fuck you” attitude. You know what you mean. They know what you mean.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThey can’t touch you for it. “I’m sorry you feel that way.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nThe English language is good like that. It’s very nuanced, the English language.\\nLike “good luck” is a great example.\\n“Good luck” is a nice thing to say to anyone, isn’t it? Good luck.\\nBut add the words “with that.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nSuddenly, a very different meaning. “Good luck with that.” Ah, you might as well have shat in their oven.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd jokes… To me, jokes are like magnets. They attract some people, great to see you out this evening for a laugh, but like magnets, they attract and they repel. Some people are repelled by my jokes, and they’re sat at home now, online, trying to get me canceled. And to those people I say, “I’m sorry you f',\n",
       "  'eel that way.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Good luck with that.”\\n[laughs]\\n[audience laughs boisterously]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nOkay, well, I feel warmed up. Shall we try some controversial jokes?\\n[audience] Yeah!\\nI’m serious.\\n[audience laughs]\\nLet’s take it up a notch. I’ll tell you who I think’s gonna get canceled. ‘Cause they fucked a kid and then they talked about it. Hundred percent, God is gonna get canceled.\\n[audience laughs]\\nStrap in. This is happening.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWell, Mary was 14 when the Holy Ghost “came upon her.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nThey say “came upon her,” but some of it went in. Come on.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[scattered applause]\\n“The Holy Ghost.”\\nI think the “holy” in question was Mary’s vajayjay, wasn’t it?\\n[audience laughs]\\nSo the Holy Spirit fucked Mary, Mary never heard from the Holy Spirit again. Talk about getting ghosted.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[Jimmy laughs]\\nDo you think when Mary, mother of God, was fucking Joseph…\\nYour favorite, Daniel. The original motherfucker.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[chuckles]\\nYou never think of Jesus as a sock, but he was.\\n[audience laughs]\\nDo you think when Mary… [chuckles] was fucking Joseph and Joseph made Mary come, Mary shouted, “God!”\\n[audience laughs]\\nAwkward. That’s her ex.\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughs]\\nWell, what was the alternative, “Jesus Christ”?\\n[audience laughs]\\nHe’s in the next room thinking, “Shut up, Mum!”\\n[audience laughs]\\nSomeone came up to me after a show, like, very earnestly, and went, “Jesus died for your sins.” I thought, “Oh, great, so now I’ve killed the son of God and two prostitutes.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nAll right, let’s class this up, shall we? Let’s class up this gig.\\nWhen Michelangelo was commissioned by the Vatican to paint The Creation of Adam, he really knew his audience, and that’s why he gave Adam a child’s penis.\\n[audience laughs and groans]\\n[audience laughs and applauds]\\n[laughs]\\nYou all know the story of Adam and Eve, right? So God took one of Adam’s ribs in order to make Eve, but God had taken one of Adam’s ribs, so, suddenly, Adam didn’t need Eve. He could suck his own cock.\\n[audience laughs]\\nSilly old God.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd look, I tell these jokes now. I’m an atheist now. I wasn’t always. I was raised Catholic, used to go to church all the time. Late teens, early twenties, I thought I might want to be a priest.\\n[audience laughs mildly]\\nBut fundamentally, I’ve just never found kids that attractive.\\n[audience laughs and groans]\\nFor me, it’s more a hobby. I couldn’t do it as a full-time job.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAre there Christians in, thinking, “That was all a bit much”? Don’t worry. It’s all made up.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nNow, we are a little bit tight for time, so I probably can’t do my Islamic bit.\\n[audience laughs and groans]\\n[audience members] Do it!\\n[encouraging and cheering]\\nWell, obviously, I’m not going to be telling the same jokes about Muhammad I’d feel very comfortable telling about Jesus Christ, and that’s because, fun fact, I’m not a fucking idiot.\\n[audience laughs]\\nSo if you’re a Christian, and you’re sat there thinking, “That’s not fair. He’ll make jokes about Christians all day long, but he won’t make the same sort of jokes about Muslims,” well, then, maybe, as a Christian, you should think about blowing something up.\\n[audience laughs]\\nHey?\\n[audience applauds]\\nNo one’s scared of you. What are the Christians gonna do, forgive me?\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughs]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nHere’s my big news. Here’s what’s going on in my life, uh, since I was last out. Um… I’m a father now. I had kids. I’m a dad.\\n[audience cheers]\\nThank you. Very nice of you.\\nNow a lot of famous people give their kids unusual names and live to regret it. Some people consider my boy’s name to be somewhat unusual, but then they see his little face, and he does just look like an Adolf.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWe’re having a gender reveal for our kid, but we’re gonna wait until it’s 21. We want to be sure.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nThey have gender reveal parties. You’ve all heard of the gender reveal party. But you never hear about a “Are we keeping it?” party.\\n[audience laughs]\\nEleven weeks into the pregnancy, and you’ve baked a cake. Is it shaped like a baby or a vacuum cleaner?\\n[audience groans]\\nI have two kids now. Couldn’t pick a favorite. Little Jimmy and the other one.\\n[audience laughs]\\nOur boy cried all the time. We found the only thing that calmed him down was to be in the car with the engine running. Pro tip, open the garage door.\\n[audience laughs]\\nNow, you don’t have to, but if you don’t open the garage door, you run a very real risk of Rico.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience applauds]\\n[softly] Bless you, Rico. Bless you.\\nPeople that get freaked out by breastfeeding in public, they can fuck off. I’m right?\\n[audience cheers]\\nYeah. Sometimes Daddy gets thirsty.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWe’ve all tried it. Here’s a strange thing.\\nSo whenever I visit friends that have had a baby, they always tell me the same thing, they always go, “The baby has a soft bit on the top of its head where the skull is yet to fully form.” Why are they telling me that? So I know the weak spot if the baby attacks?\\n[audience laughs]\\nWhat did they think I was going to do, pick it up like a fucking bowling ball?\\n[audience laughs]\\n[mimics gripping]\\n“Where do you want this baby?”\\nMy girlfriend wants m',\n",
       "  'e to have my sperm frozen just in case she ever wants to have, you know, a come-flavored popsicle.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThe first few weeks after the birth of the child can be incredibly tough, so pro tip, to avoid postnatal depression, try not to see your wife naked.\\n[audience groans]\\n[audience member whistles loudly]\\nYeah, I shouldn’t have said it, but I’m not wrong.\\n[audience laughs]\\nHave we got mums in? Where are the mums? Give us a shout.\\n[cheering]\\nLoads of mums. We got any single mums?\\n[scattered cheers]\\nOkay, let’s hear from all the mums again.\\n[cheering]\\nYou’re all single mums.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAll mums are single mums. That’s my theory. It’s the hardest job in the world, being a mum. It’s a 24/7, 365, never-ending task, being a mum, and to your credit, ladies, you’re all doing it on your own.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nYeah. Sure, sure, some of you have got dads… there.\\n[audience laughs]\\nBut, really, stop and think about it. What are dads actually doing?\\n[audience laughs]\\nDads are, at best, babysitting their own children…\\n[audience laughs]\\n…until Mum gets back.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nAnd I realize that is disrespectful to stay-at-home dads, but, seriously, what are those pussies gonna do?\\n[audience laughs]\\nHave we got any stay-at-home dads in?\\n‘Course not! They’re at home.\\n[audience laughs]\\nLook, my point is parents are judged by vastly different metrics, even today. It’s crazy, but it’s true. To be considered a good mum, what do you gotta be? Loving, nurturing, kind, attentive, always on-call, right? Not easy to be considered a good mum. To be considered a good dad, you just gotta not fuck off.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou’ve all had that conversation.\\n“He’s a good dad.” “What do you mean?”\\n“He’s still there.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat mug that says “World’s Best Dad” should just read, “Still Here.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Too Lazy To Leave.”\\n[audience chuckles]\\n[laughs]\\nBeing a dad is amazing. You… You should try it, ladies.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIt’s like being a mum with none of the responsibility.\\n[audience laughs]\\nBeing a mum is a full-time job. Being a dad is a lovely hobby.\\n[audience laughs]\\nLook, I’ll pitch you ladies being a dad. Being a dad, it’s like being royalty within your own home.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nI get wheeled out for big occasions and photo opportunities.\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Oh, hello, you must be my child. Very nice to see you.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“And this is your sister, is it?”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“It’s another child of mine? Charmed, I’m sure.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nSnap, snap, family photo, and off I fuck.\\n[audience laughs]\\nCutting a ribbon, cutting an umbilical cord, it’s the same skill set, isn’t it? I’m royalty!\\nBeing a dad is like being… It’s like being the co-pilot of the house.\\nI take over when Mum takes a nap.\\nBut takeoff, landing, heaven forfend there’s turbulence…\\nBasically, if shit gets real, it’s my job to wake her up, and try not to fuck the stewardess.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nMums are like boxers.\\nThey’re in the ring, they’re taking punches, they’re bleeding.\\nMums are in the fight.\\nDads, we’re more like cornermen.\\nWe’re sat on a stool, shouting encouragement.\\nI’m squirting shit in her mouth. She’s spitting into a bucket.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIt’s fine. We’ve been together a long time.\\nIt’s my job to throw in the towel.\\nBut first, I’m gonna have to ask her where we keep the towels.\\n[audience laughs]\\nHave we got any dads in? Where are all the dads?\\n[cheering]\\nLoads of dads.\\nYou ever do this? You get asked to do a job round the house, you don’t like the sound of it, so you do it really bad the first time so you never get asked again?\\n[audience laughs]\\nWell, long story short, I didn’t like the sound of bathing the baby.\\n[audience laughs]\\nOh, well, I’ll check on it when I get back.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat’s one of those jobs you don’t even need to fuck up.\\nYou just need to suggest you’re going to fuck it up.\\n“Bath the baby? Not a problem, love. I’ll just boil the kettle.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’ll tell you what no one told me about, and we should all be talking about this, Christmas.\\nChristmas is incredible for dads, because it’s not just the kids that get a wonderful surprise on Christmas morning when they tear open their gifts.\\nUs dads are sat there thinking, “Oh! I wonder what we got them.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience applauds]\\nDads might as well believe in Santa Claus.\\nAll we know for sure is we were not involved.\\n[audience laughs]\\nSat there thinking… [chuckles] Sat there thinking, “That looks expensive. Who got you that?”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Did I?”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[mouthing] “For fuck’s sake, love.”\\nIf you’ve ever thanked your father for a Christmas gift, you’re a fucking idiot.\\n[audience laughs]\\nHere’s what happened last week.\\nMy kid walked in on me having sex and freaked out.\\nHe said, “Are you trying to hurt Mummy?” I said, “Well, of course not.”\\nHe said, “Well, then you better not let her catch you fucking the nanny.”\\n[audience laughs and groans]\\nLook, I was worried about becoming a father because this is what I do for a living, I tell edgy jokes.\\nAnd I was worried, becoming a dad,\\nI’d get all sentimental and I would lose some of that edge.\\nSo I’m gonna tell you a story now, true story.\\nI don’t tell many true stories on stage, so please indulge me.\\nUh, this is from the day I became a father.\\nSo if you’ve not had ki',\n",
       "  'ds, you might not know, you’ve got the go bag by the front door.\\nIt’s everything you’re gonna need for the hospital in one bag.\\nYou got the babygrows, the nappies, the wash bag, the nightie, the dressing gown.\\nIt’s all in the go bag so you’re good to go when the time comes.\\nNow, you pack it quite early when it’s your first kid.\\nSeriously. My dick wasn’t dry, we had the go bag ready.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd a good job too, because 34 weeks into the pregnancy, we had a medical emergency.\\nWe got rushed to hospital, we had to have an emergency Cesarean section at 34 weeks, which was gut-wrenching.\\n[audience groans and laughs]\\nNow, if you deliver at 34 weeks, you find out very quickly as a parent, it’s all about lung development.\\nAre the baby’s lungs gonna be developed enough to breathe unaided, or is there going to have to be a medical intervention, intubation, and all of the associated drama?\\nNow, thankfully, my child’s lungs were developed enough that he could breathe unaided, but he was very premature.\\nSo the average birth weight in the UK, about eight pounds.\\nHe was under four pounds.\\n[audience members exclaim]\\nThey handed me my son, umbilical cord still attached, he fit in the palms of my hands.\\nAnd it’s very binary for men.\\nWe don’t have nine months of pregnancy and hormones to get our head around the idea of being parents.\\nWe’re not, and then suddenly we are.\\nSuddenly, there’s something in the world more important than us, and it needs looking after, and that’s our job.\\nAnd my first job as a parent, first thing I ever had to do for my boy, was to find him something to wear.\\n[audience laughs]\\nBecause in the aforementioned go bag, I brought babygrows for a full-term baby, ’cause that’s what everyone thinks they’re gonna get.\\nLife doesn’t always work out that way.\\nSo we had this little premature baby to take care of, so the nurses told me where to go.\\nThere’s a clothing store, they’ve got everything for kids, about three blocks from the hospital, got everything, and they’ve got this section of stuff for premature babies.\\nNow, I’d never seen the babygrows for a premature baby.\\nIf you’ve not seen them, they’re heartbreakers.\\nYou can’t believe a human being could fit into something so fragile and delicate and tiny.\\nThey’re like dolls’ clothes.\\nSo I rushed in there, I picked up what they had in his size, they had three in his size, so I grabbed them and I took them up to the counter.\\nAnd this lovely lady behind the counter said, “Do you want the coat hangers?”\\nI said, “I think it’s a bit late for that.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nOh, the relief!\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’d been a dad about 90 minutes, I thought, “This changes nothing!”\\n[audience laughs]\\nIt’s a genuinely true story. The look on her face…\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd then I did want the coat hangers, and she didn’t want to give ’em to me.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nMy girlfriend put me on the spot recently. She said, “What are my ten best features?”\\nI said, “I like your optimism.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Ten? Wind your fucking neck in, love.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“I couldn’t name three. I’m still here.”\\nWho’s engaged to be married? Is anyone here engaged?\\n[scattered cheers]\\nYou… You guys are engaged, down here. Fab. What’s your name, sir?\\nChris.\\nChris.\\nUh, and you’re from…\\n‘Stralia.\\n‘Stralia. Which bit of ‘Stralia?\\nSydney.\\nSydney. We’ve heard of it.\\nI love it. Okay, and you’re from…\\nHere.\\nFrom here. What’s your name, madam?\\nLeann.\\nHey, Leann. Hey, Chris.\\nWell, congratulations.\\nWhat was the proposal like? That’s always my question.\\nBecause there’s the middle class and the working class.\\nThose are the two… Are you all familiar?\\nI’ll… I’ll go through it.\\nOkay, so your middle-class proposal, it’s… it’s your classic, your cliché, the man goes down on one knee, he’s got the ring in a box, opens the ring box, diamond glimmers in her eyes, places the ring on her finger.\\nShe knows what’s going on. She’s no dummy. But he says it anyway.\\n[sobs] “Will you make me the happiest man in the world and be my wife?”\\n[audience laughs]\\nShe cries, he cries, there’s often a snot bubble.\\nIt’s a very emotional day.\\nAnd then there’s a photo shoot with her finger so it doesn’t look fat in the photo…\\n[audience laughs]\\n…that must be sent to everyone she’s ever fucking met.\\nThat’s your classic middle-class proposal.\\nIt’s a cliché, but it’s a cliché ’cause it works for people.\\nAnd that’s as distinct from the working-class proposal.\\nLittle bit different.\\nThat’s where the woman… Not the man, thank you very much.\\n…where the woman pisses on a stick.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[whistles melodically]\\n“We’re getting married.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nWhich… Which one was it?\\n[both] The last one.\\nThe last one. Yeah, well, that’s… There’s no shame in it.\\nDouble congratulations, guys.\\nWell, fair enough. He’s from… He’s from Australia.\\nIt’s considered posh there if your baby’s tattoos are spelled correctly.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWho’s in this situation? Who’s in a long-term relationship, but he’s not asked yet?\\n[cheering]\\nWell, the… there’s a big one there. Which… Which guy?\\nThis guy. How long you been together?\\n[woman] Ten and a half years.\\nTen and a half years, okay. What’s your name, madam?\\nDaniela.\\nDaniela. Hi, Daniela.\\nHi.\\nAnd what’s your name, sir?\\nLouie.\\nLouie.\\nDaniela, do you wanna know why Louie hasn’t asked you to marry him?\\n‘Cause I could ',\n",
       "  'tell you. I can see it from here.\\n[audience laughs and groans]\\nAnd the irony’s gonna kill you, Daniela, ’cause the reason he’s not gonna ask you to marry him is the same reason that you love that man.\\nI say “man.” I should say “boy,” because there’s a child in those eyes.\\nYou’re a dreamer, aren’t you, Louie? He’s a dreamer, Daniela.\\nHe’s a dreamer, and he thinks one day he could do better.\\n[audience laughs and exclaims]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nBut I don’t want you to worry.\\n[audience laughs]\\n‘Cause one day, he will give up and settle.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[Jimmy laughs]\\nMy point, ladies, is proposals are not romantic.\\nThere’s a reason men propose on their knees.\\nThey’ve fucking given up.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI don’t really understand mother-in-law jokes.\\nI’ve never really got what mother-in-law jokes are meant to be, because, really, what is your mother-in-law?\\nWhen you think about it, gentlemen, it’s Christmas Future.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah. Let that sink in. Your mother-in-law, that’s what you’ve got in the post.\\n[audience laughs]\\nSo you guys are getting married, right? Have you met her mum?\\nYes.\\nYou have? Okay. So if you picture her mum now, in your mind’s eye, if you can’t imagine yourself hanging out the back of it…\\n[audience laughs]\\n…then I don’t think this relationship really has a future, so…\\nHere’s my question to you, and I hate to put you on the spot.\\nWould you fuck her mum?\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’m gonna need an answer on this.\\nA yes or a no. It’s gotta be yes or no.\\nYes.\\nYou’re saying yes. Just…\\n[audience laughs and exclaims]\\nIt’s the right answer.\\n[audience laughs and applauds]\\nI realize that might feel slightly uncomfortable, but that’s the right answer. That means he loves you for reals.\\n‘Cause… I’ll explain what’s going on.\\nYou’re marrying this beautiful woman. You’re a beautiful woman… now.\\n[audience laughs]\\nBut you’re gonna morph into your mum over the next 25 years.\\nThere’s nothing we can do about that. That is just nature.\\nAnd your mum is, let’s assume, a fucking state.\\n[audience laughs]\\nSome offense.\\nBut at no point is he going to look at you and go, “Ooh, no, I’d be thumbing in a softie. I’m out.”\\nThis is…\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is actually very romantic.\\nMaybe… I don’t know if you’re writing your own vows, but maybe we could work this into your big day.\\nAt some point, he could clink a glass…\\n“Do I love her? I’ll say. I’d fuck her mum.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\n[laughs]\\nNow, have we got young men in, 18, 19 years of age, out with family?\\nThat’s what we’re looking for.\\n[man] Yeah.\\nWhat’s your name, man?\\n[man] Jacob.\\nWho are you here with?\\n[Jacob] My dad.\\nYour dad?\\n[Jacob] Yeah.\\nWhat age are you, Jacob?\\n[Jacob] Nineteen.\\n[mimics accent] Nineteen. Jacob.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAll right, Jacob. Look, I’ll explain what’s going on.\\nSo… women, very good at communicating, not just with each other, intergenerationally.\\nWomen talk to girls, let them know what’s up, and that’s why girls are not fucking dummies.\\nYoung men could be fucking dummies.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIt’s not your fault, Jacob. It’s our fault, it’s society’s fault.\\nThere’s not enough sex education for young men.\\nWell, that changes now.\\n[audience laughs]\\nJacob, we’re gonna have the talk.\\n[audience laughs]\\nHave you had the talk with your dad?\\nNo.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWell, don’t worry, Jacob. I’m your daddy now.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThe reason I wanted to talk to you, there’ve been some exciting developments in dating, Jacob.\\nConsent has become very popular.\\n[audience laughs]\\nOh, consent is all the rage these days.\\nIt’s the new fingerblasting, Jacob.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAre you familiar with the shocker?\\nTwo in the pink, one in the stink. That’s how that works.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou’re right. He’s only young.\\nTwo in the goo, one in the poo. There, fine.\\n[audience laughs]\\nHere’s everything you need to know about consent, young Padawan.\\nConsent is a one-use deal. One consent per action. Yeah?\\nSo a thumbs-up to “May I kiss you?” cannot, will not, ever give you blanket cover for the evening, Jacob.\\nYou can’t then assume the fucking and the anal and the facial.\\nNo, Jacob. No.\\n[audience laughs]\\nOne consent per action.\\nThink of it like condoms. One use only.\\nSure, a young lady might tell you she cares deeply about the environment, but you should see her face when you’re rinsing out a condom.\\n[audience laughs]\\nEven Greta Thunberg would say, “No, no, throw a fresh one up me.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nWell, let me ask the grown men in the room.\\nWho thinks it ruins the romance to ask for consent at every stage of a sexual encounter?\\n[scattered men] Yeah.\\nWell, you may be rapists.\\n[audience laughs]\\nNot good role models for you, Jacob. His idea of safe sex is wearing a balaclava.\\n[audience laughs]\\nHe thinks foreplay’s an uncovered drink.\\n[audience groans]\\nHis favorite chat-up line is, “Does anyone know you’re here?”\\n[audience laughs]\\nBut you, you know, you’re 19.\\nWe can mold you, as from clay, into the man we want to see in the future. This is exciting.\\nHere’s the key thing. Communication, Jacob.\\nTalk to the girl that you’re with.\\nFuck being embarrassed. Fuck being shy.\\nTalk to the girl.\\n[audience applauds]\\nThat’s it. It’s that simple.\\nAsk her, “Do you mind if I touch you there?”\\n“Is it okay if we try this?”\\n“Is it in yet?”\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd really, I think we need to rebrand consent for men of your age,',\n",
       "  ' because for young men, consent sounds like the boring bit before the fun happens.\\nIt’s the paperwork before you get your hands on the jet ski.\\nThat analogy works best if she’s a squirter.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAsk your mum.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience applauds]\\n[laughs]\\nBut consent can be half the fun, because really, consent, all it is is dirty talk done right.\\n“But how do I do dirty talk right, Jimmy?”\\nGreat question, Jacob. I’ll tell you.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThree elements to getting dirty talk right.\\nElement one, right, uh, say what you see. Check everyone is on the same page.\\n“I’m hard. You’re wet.”\\nStating the obvious like a sexual Rain Man.\\n[audience laughs]\\nStage two, say what you want to happen.\\nNine times out of ten, it’s gonna be, “I wanna fuck you.”\\nYou’d struggle to mess it up, Jacob. You’re a bright boy.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[laughing] Stage three…\\n[audience chuckles]\\n…ask questions. And here’s the great news, there’s no bad questions.\\nAsk what you want. “Do you want a thumb in your bum?”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Will you put your thumb in my bum?” It’s all good.\\n[audience laughs]\\nLet’s talk about enthusiastic consent.\\nJacob, have you heard the phrase, “Enthusiastic consent”?\\nNo, I haven’t.\\nOkay. Well, it’s a great idea.\\nIt’s a bad expression. I don’t love it.\\n“Enthusiastic consent” makes it sound like she’s gotta make a banner saying, “Fuck me, Jacob,” dressed as a cheerleader with the pom-poms and the dancing.\\nThat’d be lovely. Not necessary.\\nAll enthusiastic consent means is what she says and her body language need to match up perfectly. It needs to make sense.\\nSo no means no. You know that?\\nOf course you do.\\nYes does not always mean yes. I’ll explain.\\nSo if a girl says yes to sex with you, but she says it through gritted teeth, like she’s in a fucking horror movie…\\n[audience laughs]\\n“Yes, Jacob. I want you to fuck me.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nDon’t.\\n[audience laughs]\\nIf a girl says yes to sex with you but she’s physically tensing, like something’s going to hit her in the stomach, don’t fuck her.\\nGreat rule of thumb for you, if she’s stiffer than your dick, don’t fuck her.\\n[audience laughs]\\nOkay, well, look, we’ve covered the basics. You seem like a bright boy.\\nShould we take it up a gear?\\n[audience] Yeah.\\nJacob, do you know how to tell when a woman is ovulating?\\n[scattered laughing]\\nYeah, that’s women giggling, and men going, “What?”\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou can tell when a woman is ovulating, ’cause when a woman is ovulating, Jacob, she’ll fuck you.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAll the women in here know. There are women in here right now with men they wouldn’t have looked at twice anywhere else in their cycle.\\nThey were ovulating, so they fucked him.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThe funny thing is there are men in this room that think they seduced that woman.\\nNo. She was ovulating. She would have fucked anyone that night.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nBasically, when she’s ovulating, her pussy is eating her thigh.\\n[growling]\\n[audience laughs]\\n[continues growling]\\nI don’t do many impersonations. [growls]\\nI do a very passable ravenous vagina.\\n[growls]\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience applauds]\\nAnd look, I know this might seem patronizing.\\nYou’re… You’re 19, I’m 50.\\nI’m talking down to you literally and metaphorically, but I want you to get something out of this, so I’m gonna share with you now the best advice I’ve ever had on women, dating, and relationships.\\nThis is wisdom passed down through the ages.\\nYou thought you’re seeing a comedy show with your dad.\\nIt’s bigger than that, Jacob. Tonight… Tonight, you become a man.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nThis is some fucking Lion King shit.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou ready, Jacob?\\nYes.\\n[Jimmy] Okay.\\nIf you live by this, I think you’re gonna do all right.\\n[scattered laughing]\\nYou ready?\\nDon’t stick your dick in crazy.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience applauds]\\nThat’s it. That’s it.\\nIf you meet a girl, Jacob, doesn’t matter how attractive she is, if she seems a bit mental, don’t stick your dick in it.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI want you to view that woman as you would a food blender.\\n[audience laughs and groans]\\nHave you got a food blender in the house?\\nOf course you have. You ever put your dick in it? No.\\nReal smart. Same-same.\\n[audience laughs]\\nDon’t stick your dick in crazy. And look, you might be a dreamer.\\nI don’t know, Jacob. You might be thinking even now, “Yeah, but what if it’s a supermodel from Paris?”\\nWell, if it is, and she’s talking to you, she’s definitely fucking mental.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAll right, quick pop quiz for Jacob. Let’s see where he’s at.\\n[audience chuckles and exclaims]\\nYou’re gonna do fine, Jacob.\\nAre you aware, Jacob, there are different types of consent?\\nSure, yeah.\\n[audience laughs]\\nTalk us through them, Jacob.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat’s a little bonus lesson for you, Jacob.\\nDon’t bullshit a bullshitter, kid.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’ll walk you through this.\\nSo, you’ve got… You’ve got consent to fuck.\\nThat’s the big one. The headline act. “Consent to fuck.”\\nThat gets all the attention, Jacob, but there’s other consents.\\nThere’s consent to get your dick out, Jacob.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience laughs]\\nWhen’s a good time to get your dick out, Jacob?\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’ll tell you what.\\nLet’s workshop this.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYeah, let’s gamify it. We’re laughing and we’re learning.\\nWhat fun we’re having.\\nI’m gonna give you some scenarios, right, you’ve just gotta tell me ',\n",
       "  'yes or no.\\nIs it a good time to get your dick out? You up for this, Jacob?\\nGive him some encouragement. It’s Jacob, everyone.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nThat’s right.\\nThat’s right. Good on you. Now…\\nSo, first scenario, Jacob. You’ve asked a girl out on a date.\\nShe’s agreed to go on a date with you.\\nAnd why wouldn’t she, you fucking dreamboat?\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou pick her up at hers at seven in the evening, you ring the doorbell.\\nDing-dong.\\nShe answers the door. She’s all dressed up for the date.\\nYou’re stood there, dick out, ding-dong.\\n[audience laughs]\\nLet her see what you’ve got in store for her.\\nPointless wasting her time if she doesn’t like the look of the merchandise.\\nWhat do you think, Jacob. Yes or no?\\nThat’s a no.\\n“That’s a no” is the right answer!\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nPerfect. One for one.\\nSecond scenario, right. You’re having dinner with the girl.\\nIt’s going great, the conversation is flowing easily.\\nYou’re laughing at her jokes, she’s laughing at yours.\\nThere’s a bit of chemistry in the air.\\nYou say, “Look, enjoy dessert, but leave room for this sweet dick.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nWhat do you think, Jacob? Yes or no?\\nMaybe.\\n[audience laughs]\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat was a fucking lay-up, kid. That was…\\n“Maybe”?\\n[audience laughs]\\nYou’re in a restaurant…\\n[audience laughs]\\nIn a public place. There’s food around.\\n[audience laughs]\\nYes or no, Jacob?\\nOkay, no.\\nIs the right answer.\\n[audience applauds]\\nNow… Third scenario.\\nYou’re back at hers. There’s no one else in the house. You’re on the sofa, making out, kissing and a-cuddling. You’ve got her top off.\\n[mimics honking]\\n[audience laughs]\\nSidebar, you make the noise in your head.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWell, if I don’t tell him, who will?\\n[audience laughs]\\nI feel like I’ve solved a mystery there for quite a lot of the ladies. You’ve always wondered what that gormless expression on his face was when he was honking away on your tits. [mimics honking] Clown horn in his head. It takes concentration.\\n[audience chuckles]\\nAll right, Jacob. So you’re making out with her, you’ve got her top off, she’s wetter than a submarine with a screen door. Oh!\\n[audience laughs]\\nOh, it’s like an otter’s pocket.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWetter than a penguin on a Slip ‘N Slide.\\n[audience laughs]\\nWhat do you think, Jacob? Good time to get your dick out?\\nYes.\\nNo, Jacob! No! Bad boy! Dirty boy! No! Don’t get your dick out! Don’t get your dick out! Never get… Look at me! Don’t get your dick out! Bad boy! Dirty boy! Don’t get your dick out! Never get your dick… Never get your dick out! Don’t get your dick out! Never get your dick out, Jacob! Let her get your dick out.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThen you’re gold. Then you’re gold!\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nThank you so much for being out. I really appreciate everyone. That’s it. Thank you very much, everyone! Cheers. Good night! Thank you very much. It’s very sweet of you. Cheers. Thanks for coming out, everyone. Cheers.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\nHey!\\nTake care. Safe home.

Thanks for coming. I appreciate it! God damn! Put your phone down, f*ckface! I see you, b*tch! Put your phone down! Motherf*ckers. They can’t use their eyes. Everybody’s gotta live through their goddamn phone. Whoo! I’m high as f*ck. Whoo. It’s strange. I wasn’t sure if I was gonna do this sober. I’m like, “Ugh…” It’s not the move. Not in San Francisco. This is… I love pot, but the people that are making edibles need to slow the f*ck down. Oh, my God! What are you trying to do to people?\\nI had a pot gummy bear the other day. I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn’t be able to steal your soul. Right? How the f*ck are these people making these things, man? They’re not consistent. That’s also part of the problem. You don’t know what you’re getting, ’cause they’re not making them the same place where they make Tylenol. Nah, it’s some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead T-shirt on and a gray ponytail. He’s got a bowl of ingredients, and he can’t remember whether or not he put weed in yet. This dude’s time traveling, just back and forth. He just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings. You eat it, and it’s not what you’re looking for. It’s not regulated. You gotta ask questions. I asked a dude at the pot store. I go, “Hey, man, how strong are the gummy bears?” He goes… That’s not a unit of measurement. He’s like, “El diablo. El diablo.” “F*ck, man. How much should I take?” “Just the leg.” “Just the leg? Why are you selling whole bears? What the f*ck are you trying to prove, man?” They just watch you leave with that bear. They go, “Oh, shit.” They know. They know you’re not gonna die. You’re gonna think you’re gonna die, but everybody lives. Learn some shit.\\nWe learn some shit from the scary trips. See, the thing about edibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that a lot of us don’t have a lot of information that we could use. Like, there’s a difference between smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it, you get THC. But when you eat it, it’s processed by your liver, and it produces something called 11-hydroxy metabolite that’s five times more psychoactive than THC. And it lets you talk to dolphins.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis is a real moment that changed my life. I was in Hawaii, and we were on a boat, and we were fishing. We were pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I was trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. Like, the boat’s going this way, and the sun’s up there. I’m like, “Um…” For like 20 minutes, I’m paralyzed. So, while this is all happening, these dolphins just show up. And if you’ve ever been around wild dolphins, they’re very trippy. It’s very different than you expect, because they look at you. They, like, check you out. They, like, pop out of the water and they, like, look at you… like a person, not like a f*cking deer or woodchuck. They look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I thought I was gonna die, but… I’m making eye contact with these dolphins, and I started thinking, “How smart are these f*cking things?” Because we’re fishing. Dolphins eat fish. But you never catch dolphins. Ever. No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. And all I could think of while these dolphins were, like, hopping through the water, and looking at us and shit… I was thinking, “If people lived in the water, you’d f*cking catch ’em all day.” They wouldn’t even have to live in the water. If cheeseburgers just floated down Geary Street… at least once a week, a guy would be like, “I’m taking a chance.” And you see ’em getting yanked up to the clouds. “F*ck! We lost Billy!” The bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud.\\nYou don’t catch dolphins on fishhooks, man. That’s weird. They’re around fishing all the time and like, “B*tch.” They’re f*cking smart. How smart? Well, I watched a dolphin documentary, and it said they have a cerebral cortex that’s 40% larger than a human being’s. I don’t know what that means, but if you say it right and don’t f*ck up the words, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. I think what it means is they have big f*cking brains. But we don’t think of them as being smart ’cause they don’t do what we do. Right? They don’t send e-mails. They don’t have houses. But if you lived in their world, you don’t need anything. You don’t need your fingers. No one’s typing. They have a language that’s so complex, we can’t understand it. All the food’s free. They stay where the water’s warm. I started thinking, “How f*cking smart are they? What if ',\n",
       "  'they’re exactly the same as us? What if it’s just some different branch of evolution? We went one way. They went the other. What if consciousness is the same?” I was thinking, “What if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin?” The way you think of yourself when you say the word “me.” I was like, “What if that’s exactly how a dolphin feels? They’re just living life through different biology, different genetics, different life experiences. But if I lived a dolphin’s life, I would be him. And if he lived my life, he would be me.” And then I started thinking, “What if that’s the case with people? What if everyone is exactly the same? We’re just living life through different bodies. What if that’s the secret of happiness? Treat everyone as if it’s you living another life.”\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\nI mean… And then I thought, “God damn, how good is this weed I’m getting in California? Whoo! I’m on a f*cking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean, talking to water people.” The problem with treating everybody as if it’s you living another life is you wanna f*cking smack yourself. Half the people you meet, you just wanna f*cking smack ’em.\\nWe live in the weirdest time ever. I mean, it’s the most awesome time ever. But it’s the weirdest time ever, too. We’re, like, that close to President Trump.\\n[man 2] No. Boo!\\n“No. Boo!” You boo, but you won’t vote, you f*cks! All those Bernie Sanders people, “Yo, Bernie’s the shit.” “Did you vote for him?” “Voting ain’t real, bro. It doesn’t even work, dude.” We are that close to President Trump. Bill Cosby’s a rapist, and Bruce Jenner’s a chick. We’re in an episode of Lost. Down is up and up is down! This is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games. This is the world we get! We get a goddamn Nerfed-up world filled with nonsense.\\nNobody wants to be president. Nobody. I hope Hillary wins. That way we can realize chicks can’t do that f*cking job either. It’s a stupid job. It’s a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers. It’s dumb! It’s just some old-school shit that we need to get rid of. It doesn’t make any sense. Being president is great if there’s like 50 people. If there’s 50 people, you can figure out which one’s the best. Three hundred million people? I have three kids. I don’t know where the f*ck they are right now. How is this one dude in charge of 300 million people? It’s nonsense. It’s so old and stupid. They make this guy sleep in this f*cking White House. If Trump wins, you know his house is cooler than the White House. He’s like, “I’m not sleeping in that shitty-ass, stupid house.” Trump’s probably got, like, a tube at home that he opens up, and a Chinese girl just pops out of it, and sucks his dick and goes right back in. That’s what I would do if I had that kind of money. We’re down to assholes! Where’s Elon Musk when you need him? Where’s the f*cking geniuses? Where’s Mark Cuban? No. We got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the ’90s. We got an old man who hates money. And we got a reality TV star with a plastic set of hair. You can’t have a president with environmental concerns, when every time this motherf*cker does his hair, we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames. He’s got, like, a closet full of Aqua Net at home. You can’t pretend you don’t give a f*ck when you have that thing going on, dude. Stop that.\\nThe White House got broken into while Obama was in office. The first time in over 100 years that someone broke into the White House. Also, the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself. “What are you trying to say, that women can’t do everything men can do?” Exactly. That’s exactly what I’m saying. That seems sexist, right? People say, “You’re sexist.” No, it’s not sexist. Here’s why it’s not sexist. ‘Cause men can’t even do everything men can do. See? There’s no physical equality, folks. That’s why we have the Olympics. ‘Cause there’s people that can do some shit that you and I can’t do. One of those things is guarding the f*cking White House. I know I can’t guard the White House. You know how I know? Because I’ve met Shaquille O’Neal and his dick is where my face is. That’s not equality. That’s not white privilege. Listen, if the White House is experiencing a Shaq Attack, I’m the wrong dude to save the world. I did Fear Factor with Shaq. If we’re holding hands, it’d be like a six-year-old at the park with his dad. We’re barely the same thing. So, do I think women should guard the White House? No. I don’t think I should, either. It’s not sexist to say that women can’t do big physical labor things as good as giant men can. But people will tell you it is.\\nWell, I’m not sexist. As a matter of fact, my favorite people are all female. I have a wife and I have three daughters. They’re my favorite people in the world. But I could beat the f*ck out of all of them. Okay? Listen… If they’re guarding the door, I’m getting in. I don’t mean to sound cocky. But I’m just real confident. I could f*ck them up if I had the flu. Okay? Yeah, we’re different. We’re different. I could beat up my cat, too. I’m not proud of it. I just tell you what’s up. If you wanna bet money, bet money on me. I’ll f*ck that cat up. Most likely. Cats are f*cking weird like that, man. I was petting my cat once and he bit me. I was like, “Whoa! Are we gonna do this? What the f*ck are you doing here?” I got a little nervous. Got a little nervous. “Women can do everything men can do. This guy’s a piece of shit. We’re leaving. Too much information is going in that I don’t agree with!” “What the guy said wa',\n",
       "  's total bullshit. Total bullshit.”\\nHow’d that girl get that job? I’ll tell you how that girl got that job. Because someone let her have that job. Which means, either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her… or her boss was a chick and she hated her. Either one’s possible. Look, if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to f*ck her, that makes total sense. If there’s one hot girl and she’s working with five guys in an office, no work’s getting done in that office. That office is now just an audition to see which guy gets to f*ck her. Each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes. Men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole. “There’s gotta be a f*cking way. There’s gotta be a f*cking way!” You got this girl who’s like, “I could guard the front door.” “Oh, you could definitely guard the door. No doubt. No doubt.” And over time, if this woman doesn’t sleep with one of these men and claim him, over time, these guys will just start morphing. And they’ll just start saying ridiculous, preposterous shit. “Debbie wants to guard the front door. Do you have a problem with that?” “No, I don’t. As a matter of fact, I think women are amazing. Plus, I’m vegan.” And they will just… They will wear patchouli. They will do what the f*ck they have to do. Next thing you know, poor f*cking Debbie at the front door… “Why am I alone?” [chuckles]\\nThe whole story is so bananas. And it’s one of my favorite stories. So I’m gonna give you the whole story of the break-in at the White House with no edits and no comic exaggerations. This is the real story. ‘Cause a lot of people think there’s some grand conspiracy. There’s some cabal of evil geniuses that’s pulling the strings on everyone in America. It’s most likely that people are just dumb as f*ck, in all sorts of walks of life. This is the story. This is the real story about the person who broke into the White House. First of all, people are always worried, “The government’s checking out my e-mails, bro. The government’s watching us all the time.” They pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the White House. He had four handguns, two rifles and a machete with him. They didn’t even watch him. He had a map. On the map was Washington, and it had an “X” where the White House is. They’re like, “You’re good to go.” They let him go! Two months later, this motherf*cker broke into the White House. And why did he break into the White House? Why do you break into the White House ever? Because you want to die. You don’t… That’s like a suicide run. That’s the only reason why someone runs toward the White House. If you had to ask someone, “What kind of security do you think they have at the White House?” “Oh, dude… they got snipers on every corner. They got lasers in the grass. If you get too far, they open up a door, you drop right into jail.” Nope. Turns out they don’t even have a dog. You just f*cking run. The guy who made it into the White House, he had 800 rounds of ammunition in his car. Left that there. Took a knife. That’s a guy who wants to die! He’s just sitting in his f*cking car going, “F*ck the government! F*ck my ex-wife! And f*ck everybody! I’m gonna do this! F*ck you!” Just sprinting, “Oh, my God, I’m doing it! Oh, my God, I’m doing it!” Thinking, with every step, “This is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this…” And he gets to the front door. It’s unlocked! He opens it. There’s a girl there by herself. Smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall. Ah! He’s probably going, “Why am I alive?” He’s probably thinking… He was inside for minutes. For minutes, running around. He got tackled by an off-duty officer. He was probably thinking, “I wanted to die. I don’t want to go to f*cking jail. Will somebody please shoot me?” Then he was probably pissed. “Where are my tax dollars going? What kind of security are you f*cking people running in this place?” [chuckles]\\nImagine when Obama found out a girl was guarding him. He was probably like, “Everybody, everybody, not that much diversity. I mean, what, are you playing f*cking fairy tale games here?”\\nObama’s got a hard job, ’cause he’s the first president that’s ever been around while Google was here. You know, he could Google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night. Right? “So, let me see what the people have to say.” He’d just go, “Obama is a…” [groans] “I’m none of those f*cking things.” Freakin’ out. Shit. [sighs] Probably thinking, “Why the f*ck did I do this?” I think the guy who broke into the White House and Obama probably have a lot in common. In that… they went for it, but they probably never really thought they were getting in there. You can’t quit once you’re the president. The moment Obama actually got into office, like, “Good morning, Mr. President,” he was probably like, “Oh, no! What the f*ck did I do this for? I didn’t think I was actually gonna get in. [sighs] I can’t sleep. I’m freaking out. Everybody wants to kill me. [exhales heavily] Who the f*ck is guarding me?” Looks out in the hallway. There’s a girl taking selfies. That’d be the greatest selfie of all time. A girl with her ass out, duck lips, in the background, a dude’s breaking into the White House. [laughs]\\nYou know I’m not making this up. You’ve all seen this. This is recognizable. Pigeon-toed is a good move ’cause you can’t get away that good. You just, like… Like there’s something wrong with your back. That’s a recognizable pose. When did that start? ‘Cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures, everybody just stood ther',\n",
       "  'e looking hungry. Like, if you saw a photo from the 1800s, and in the background a girl was going… She’s a f*cking time traveler! Nobody knew that move back then. Somebody had to see their face. “Oh, people like that. They like what I’m doing.” Combo. A two-hole combo attractor. It’s all over online! It gets you a lot of likes.\\nI saw a gal on Instagram, she has eight million followers. All she does is take pictures of her ass. That’s it. She’s got a winning formula. She sticks with it. No witty memes. There’s no inspirational quotes. Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. Just a lot of this. Different ways. And she’s just a regular girl, man. I’m watching this, I’m like, “This is a different kind of person.” She has eight million people that have no idea what her voice sounds like. She doesn’t have a job that they like. She doesn’t have an occupation that they follow. They’re just staring at her ass. This is a new kind of human. There’s never been a person, psychologically, that’s had to navigate those kind of waters. If you really stop and think about it, science should really step in and start looking at this. Don’t go to South America to study some new frog that nobody gives a f*ck about. There’s a girl in Florida with eight million people staring at her ass. How does this girl keep a relationship? What is her day like? How many dick pics does she get sent? How many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis? Is it like the national debt counter was just f*cking spinning out of control constantly? I bet if she turns on the notifications, her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her. I bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone, it would be physically lighter. This is a new kind of person. We really have to understand, there’s never been a person like this before. And she’s just a person. Like, that kind of influence, that kind of attractant, that’s a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl. And as a guy who has daughters, I just think of that, like, that’s kind of f*cking… That’s weird. Because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass. Eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her. I mean, I follow her, but I’m not like those other assholes. I’m different. I care. I care about who she is. I’m a nice person. I’m a hero or something. [laughs] “I’m different. Those other guys are assholes. Men are noble. Men are noble and true.” Mmm. If we get to come. If men don’t get to come, we get real Sméagol-like real quick. Just a few months of no dates, [imitating Gollum] “Mesus is just so disappointed with all the mens mesus meets. Mesus is so embarrassed at how other mens talks to you. Mmm. Oh.”\\nEveryone wants to set themselves up as being the noble one. Everybody wants to be Matthew McConaughey, to save the world on a rocket ship. There’s people that are signing up to go to Mars. Do you know about this? There’s a mission to Mars, a manned mission to Mars, where 200,000 people have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on Mars. They’re gonna take a one-way trip to Mars. That’s some sad shit for a bunch of reasons. First of all, it’s some sad shit, ’cause that’s 200,000 people that don’t have any real friends. Right? If it’s someone you love, your real friend… If one of my friends is gonna move to Florida, I’ll be like, “B*tch, where the f*ck are you going? You’re gonna go to Florida? We can’t hang out if you go to Florida. Why the f*ck are you moving to Florida, man?” But you might be able to deal with it. “We can just visit each other every now and then.” But if your friend was gonna move to Mars, you’d be like, “Oh, really? Get in the f*cking car! Just get in the car, dude.” Take him out to Death Valley, “Look around! Sucks, right? Mars sucks worse. Get back in the car, stupid.” Jesus Christ! There’s places in America you can’t live, man. You don’t wanna live in Detroit, why the f*ck are you talking about moving to Mars? People really consider moving to Mars. It’s one of the dumbest ideas ever. But if you say that, people will eco-bro you. Have you ever been eco-broed? These people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you, as Michael Shermer likes to point out. Like, puff their chest out and say that they’re probably better than you. “Hey, dude. Seriously? You think there’s something wrong with going to Mars? Well, I don’t know if you’ve paid attention, man. We maybe should colonize Mars ’cause California’s almost out of water.” Then he’ll nod, like, “Yeah, b*tch.” We’re right next to the ocean. What the f*ck are you talking about? Look at all that water. You fly over it, it takes a day. The world’s blue. It’s more water than it is not water. We have a salt problem. We don’t have a water problem. Suck the salt out of the water, we got a goddamn party. Instead of pissing and moaning… “Too complicated, bro. We gotta go to Neptune.” Oh, my God! You’re f*cking crazy. We’re a crazy race filled with crazy people. We’re like a dude with a dirty house. Like, “Man, I gotta build a new house.” No, you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen. Stop piling up newspapers you’re never gonna read in front of your bathroom, you f*ck! We’re crazy! One-way trip to Mars. A one-way trip in coach with three other people so f*cking stupid, they’re willing to die on Mars with you. Great. What great conversation you’re gonna have. It’s nonsense, folks. My friend was like, “They’re not gonna die on Mars, man. If people are smart enough to figure out how to get to Mars, they’re smart enough to figure out how to get back.” Here’s why that doesn’t make any sense. People smart enough to get to Mars aren’t going. See, that’s the dirty secret about rocket travel, lad',\n",
       "  'ies and gentlemen. Nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those f*cking things. No. No, they look at each other right before the launch and they go… They talk German and they get behind giant f*cking concrete bunkers. They take some square-jawed, corn-fed dude from the middle of the country, tuck a Bible under that dude’s arm and strap him into that giant metal dick, and shoot it off into the heavens. That’s what we do. And that is what that is. That is a metal dick. It’s a robot dick, and we’re trying to f*ck the sky. We are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets. Our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant, and they’re too filled up with people, and then they gotta make a new metal dick. “Bro, we gotta go to Jupiter.” Then they make another one. They shoot that f*cking thing, and they fill Jupiter up. We just keep filling the cosmos up with people. And we never evolve. And we never change. We stay perfect, like we are right now. Who’s in? You’re gonna all come with me. We’re gonna leave here right now and go to the Church of Scientology right down the street, and it’s all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it.\\nI watched that HBO documentary a couple too many times. I went Clear, I think. I think I’m Clear. I’m back! I’m back now. If you haven’t seen… [chuckles] I had to watch Going Clear, a Scientology documentary, ’cause I have a neighbor who’s a Scientologist, and I don’t even think he’s gay. I don’t know what the f*ck’s going on. [exhales heavily] But he sleeps really close to me, you know. Like, my bed’s here, this f*cking dude’s bed’s, like, over there. His house is… I mean, if you take away the walls, he’s f*cking right there. It’s like, “What does this crazy f*ck believe?” And Scientology is a wonderful religion. Not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone that’s ever walked the face of the Earth. And not by a small amount. This dude never made a second draft in his f*cking life. Everything was one draft of nonsense. And he wrote more of it than anybody. Not in his neighborhood, not in his state, not in a year, not in a decade. More than anyone that’s ever lived, ever. And Scientology is still like, “I don’t see any red flags. I think we’re good. I think this is legit as f*ck.” If Scientology is a good religion, it’s because other religions get to make fun of ’em. It’s like it’s the one religion that even the Mormons are like, “B*tch, you believe what? Hold on. I mean, at least we don’t have video of Joseph Smith. There’s some f*cking shitty black and white footage of L. Ron Hubbard with a captain’s outfit on. You wanna explain that? [chuckles] Why does he have all those awards on? Why is Tom Cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate? What the f*ck is going on with you people?” I watched it with my mom, and it was like… First of all, Scientology, they don’t pay taxes. That’s disturbing. They’re tax-free, which means they’re a recognized religion by the government of the United States. Which means the government of the United States had to go over what they believe and went, “Everything seems in order. None of this shit seems like a cult.” Well, what the f*ck is a cult, and what’s a religion? So I had to look it up. Turns out… I don’t know who wrote this, but it’s a perfect definition. A cult is bullshit. It’s created by one person. That person knows it’s bullshit. In a religion, that dude’s dead. So it’s a religion ’cause L. Ron Hubbard’s dead. So I guess they got it on a loophole. I watched it with my mom, and my mom was like, “I can’t believe anybody would fall for that.” “You made me go to Catholic school. The f*ck are you talking about? There was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne, and you made me call him Father. Slow your roll, lady.” Imagine if I talked to my mom like that.\\nOh, my God. Jokes, folks. Just jokes. I don’t have a problem with people being religious because I just think life itself is too open-ended. It’s too confusing. And I think we’re evolving. And part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions. We wanna seek these answers. But in the meanwhile, they just give you so much anxiety, and it f*cks with you so much. There’s nothing wrong with joining a cult. I think you gotta just join a nice, friendly one. Like, the Mormons are a good cult. Here’s why. They don’t get mad at anybody. Like, they never kill anybody. Like, here’s a perfect example. Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the guys who created South Park, they made a hilarious musical called The Book of Mormon. It’s fantastic. If you haven’t seen it, it’s so f*cking hilarious. But it’s also brutal! Brutal about the Mormons. You know what the Mormons did? They went to see it, and they took out a full-page ad in the playbill. It said, “If you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a Mormon, please visit our website.” They just took it right on the chin like champs. They didn’t get mad. They didn’t get defensive. They didn’t kill anybody. That’s a good cult. They just said, “What do you wanna do?” “We got nine wives. Shut the f*ck up!” “Everybody just… Everybody, just chill. Just chill.” That’s a good religion. That’s a good cult.\\nSome cults aren’t that good. They get f*cking testy. You know the one. We don’t have to say who. You know what I’m talking about. There’s that one that will kill you if you draw their guy. “Come on, man. I can’t even draw your dude? What if I draw a dude drawing your dude?” “No loopholes!” “F*ckin’ relax, bro.” And this i',\n",
       "  'sn’t just theoretical. People have died ’cause they made cartoons. Before the most recent Paris attacks, there was a magazine called Charlie Hebdo, and they were attacked, where 11 cartoonists were killed. Eleven more were wounded, and they killed a cop, too. F*cking crazy! Over cartoons! And when you… When there’s radical, crazy people in the world, what’s interesting is the reaction to radical, crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird.\\nBecause when these people got killed over a cartoon, the whole world was in shock. The whole world was outraged. But one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures. You couldn’t see ’em in the LA Times. You couldn’t find them in Time magazine. You had to go online and find them. It was a dark moment for free speech, because everybody’s like, “Oh. I don’t wanna get killed. I don’t wanna show the pictures.” It was weird, until… the balance. Because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures, word got back to Texas… where they promptly held a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. I’m not making a word of this up. You can Google it, and I’ll wait. They had a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Garland, Texas. Two dudes showed up, started shooting at the building. They were killed almost instantly. Why? Because they were at a “Draw Muhammad” contest in Texas. How obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious? What, are you livin’ in a Wile E. Coyote cartoon, motherf*cker? You ever go to Texas? That’s not Santa Monica, b*tch. That’s a totally different kind of white people. Those are some Wild West people that have computers and modern guns. They’re not supposed to be there. People didn’t evolve in Texas. It’s not like they were monkeys, then they became people and they stayed in that spot. No. No, they landed on boats on the East Coast. The stubborn ones stayed. The smart ones made it to California. But along the way, we lost a bunch of people. [audience laughs] And some of them just stuck around. “Y’all go ahead. We’re gonna hang back here. I’m gonna draw the biggest dick the world’s ever seen in the sand. My wife’s got the biggest titties. I’mma try to f*ck a snake. I think it can be done.” They just stayed. They just gathered cattle, stockpiled ammo. And they all talk alike.\\nAnd that’s why you gotta be nervous. You gotta be nervous in places with accents, okay? It’s one of the reasons why I can prove that California is the best spot to live. ‘Cause all the spots that suck, they all have to sound like each other. ‘Cause I grew up in a place like that. I grew up in Boston. It’s not that the people in Boston suck, but the weather sucks. It’s f*cking horrible. And in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning, and just goes, “F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck! F*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck, f*ck!” And everybody’s worried about… It’s a real possibility you might starve to death one day. You might freeze trying to walk home. [imitates Boston accent] So they all talk in the same way. “Oh, my God. How many more months till summer? Ahhh! When is this f*cking winter gonna be over? We need more firewood.” [whines] They have to sound like the people around them. So if other people invade, like, “We stick together. We’re all in this together.”\\nThat’s how they are in Texas, too. They’re like, “Y’all ain’t from around here, are ya?” They have a f*cking certain way of talking. Which is proof positive why California is the best spot. Try making fun of a California accent. What are you gonna do? Speak clear and concise? What are you gonna do? You gonna mock us? You’re gonna say some shit that everybody understands? They’re not supposed to be in Texas, folks. It’s not even a state. It’s a republic. They were like, “Man, we ain’t so sure about this whole United States thing. We’re gonna hang back. Hang back, see how this plays out.” They don’t have any rules. They have like three pages of rule books. Here’s how I know this. I’m gonna tell you a fact, a fact about Texas that will change the way you think about Texas. There are more tigers in captivity in Texas, in private collections, than there are in all of the wild of the world. I’m gonna repeat it because I know you’re like, “Oh, the Fear Factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work.” No. There’s more tigers in dudes’ yards in Texas than the rest of the f*cking planet! How is that possible? Because they can. Because they went through the rule book… [mumbles] “It don’t say shit about tigers. Order it up, dude. Order it up, dude!” One guy got a tiger, and his neighbor’s like, “Shit, I didn’t know we could get tigers.” And he got two tigers. And the first guy was like, “I ain’t about to let this faggot out-tiger me.” And he opened up Tiger World with his oil money. We’re gonna need those people, folks, if the Russians invade. We can’t make f*cking warrior babies with those chicks in Marin County with fake asses and rubber lips, okay? We’re gonna need some real warrior genes. We’re gonna need some women who wear non-ironic Daisy Dukes. They got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet. And they yell out, “Chris Kyle, rest in peace,” when you make ’em come. We need those women! If the Russians come, we gotta be ready. Think about the children. Think about the children while I get a sip. This is super important, ladies and gentlemen. A lot of people are sleeping on… [laughs] Imagine if I had real points. Oh, Jesus Christ. [audience cheering] I love you f*ckers, too, man. So excited to be here. [sighs]\\nI have kids and I lie to them. I get high around ’em, too. People say you shouldn’t do that, but they ',\n",
       "  'don’t see it. They say you shouldn’t be intoxicated around your children. Well, I’m not. I’m high. I call it “elevated.” It’s a different thing. The people who have a problem with that, they don’t understand what getting high is. Like, they think you’re gonna be to your kid, like, “Who are you?” What do you think? What’s the worst thing that can happen if I’m a little high around my kid? They’re gonna get extra hugs, and daddy’s going to be paranoid about objects. “Look out. Don’t go there.” That’s it. Plus, I have cool conversations. I have a six-year-old daughter, man. There’s not a lot of 48-year-old man and 6-year-old girl have in common, other than the fact she’s my daughter. And so, our conversations are normally pretty boring. But when I’m high, I’m like, “You know, you call that thing your baby, your doll. You call it your baby, but you know it’s not a baby, right?” “Yeah, I know it’s not a baby.” “Do you call it a baby because you’re the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you?” “Maybe.” “Okay. That’s cool. That’s cool. Give me a hug. I love you.” [kisses]\\nIt’s weird, man. It’s weird raising little people. There’s some things that I didn’t expect. One of the things I didn’t expect is you have to lie to them. Like, you don’t have to lie to them about a lot of things, but you have to lie to them about Santa Claus. It’s just one of those things, man, ’cause it’s like a community. You have to think about what your kid’s gonna tell other kids. Because when it comes to Santa Claus, you don’t want your kid to be one of two things. You don’t want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s an asshole. But you don’t want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that Santa Claus is bullshit, ’cause that kid’s a moron. So you got… You got a little bit of… You’re like, “Oh, no. When do we do this? When do we do this?” And no one knows when to do it. You just let the kids figure it out. Then they’re like, “Dad, what the f*ck?” You’re like, “Aw… Oh, I missed the boat. I missed the boat.” Nobody knows when to do it. Nobody can be honest about it. They have little meetings and shit. And I’m like, “When do we tell ’em?” This lady goes, “When they’re 11.” They’re gonna be f*cking by then. I told her it was funny. She didn’t believe me. I’m like, “Oh, I’m sorry. I’m off by a year.” That’s not as funny, but it’s… I didn’t mean it. But it’s this thing. They want to keep the kids in the dark. And they wanna pretend they’re the only one that’s teaching the kid. This is a weird thing that people do. They’re like, “I teach my kids, man. I teach my kids.” “Eh… when you see ’em.” But unless you’re some freak who homeschools your children in the forest, your kid’s gonna go to school. They’re gonna go to school, and they’re gonna be in a class with 50 other kids. The teacher only makes 20 bucks a year, and she’s thinking about dick. That’s all she’s thinking about. She’s thinking about getting stuffed. She’s a young, fertile woman who loves kids. And she’s writing on that chalkboard. And the kids all huddle up and share information. Like, “Yeah, what did your dad tell you? Your dad tell you that, yeah? My dad says Santa Claus is f*cking bullshit, okay? You ever go near a chimney? It’s that big. What the f*ck? Teacher’s coming. Play with blocks. Act stupid. Uh, how does this work?” They play dumb. They play dumb! They’re like little prisoners, trying to figure their way out. They make little papier-mâché heads and pretend they’re napping. They’re little humans. They wanna run shit. “Who is these people telling us what to do? Are they being straight with us, man? What the f*ck is going on?” I knew the day my daughter knew that Santa Claus is bullshit. She came home, stared me down. She was, like, mad-dogging me. She took her book bag, and just goes… [scoffs] Walked right up to the chimney, looking at me. “How the f*ck?” “Dad, have you ever met Santa Claus?” “No, honey, I’ve never met him.” “But you let him in the house?” And there’s this moment… It was a moment where a seven-year-old has you at checkmate. You’re like, “Oh, shit.” I don’t know whether to high-five her or to keep lying. You wanna go, “Yeah, you got me. You got me. You got me. That’s bullshit. No, the big bang is real, but this is bullshit.” The big bang sounds even less real. The problem is, you have to be consistent. If you’re teaching your kids nonsense, you gotta teach ’em only nonsense. You can’t mix nonsense in with, like, real stuff. Like, my daughter will go like, “How do birds fly?” I go, “Birds have bones that are hollow, so they’re really light. Then they have feathers, which cover a large surface area. And they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air. See, the air looks like it’s nothing, right? But it’s actually a bunch of gases. That’s why the trees move when the wind blows. The birds can manipulate that and go through 3-D space.” “Whoa!” “Yeah, nature is crazy.” “Yeah. How does the fat man get through the little hole?” “Magic! Christmas magic! Now go to bed. I’m trying to f*ck your mom! Go to bed!” [audience laughing]\\nJokes, folks. Just jokes. Can’t talk like that. That’s how you make strippers. You gotta be nice. They’re little, tiny people. They’re adorable. They don’t know anything yet. You gotta teach ’em everything. You can’t talk mean. [inhales sharply] Kids are a lot like really f*cking stupid people… in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room, the most confident one just starts running shit. They don’t have to have any more information, they just have to be more confident. If you get a bunch of dummies together, the',\n",
       "  'y’re like, “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I don’t know what’s going on.” “I f*cking do. I f*cking do.” The guy doesn’t have to have any extra data, he just has to be the only one that’s confident. And that’s what it’s like in school.\\nMy daughter’s class has this f*cking kid named Debbie. And every day it’s, “Debbie says…” Oh, f*cking Debbie says. Debbie says what? You don’t think about that before you have kids. Not only are you gonna have kids, but your kids are gonna make friends, and then you have to make friends with the f*cking parents of your kids. And some of ’em are crazy. My daughter’s like, “Debbie says Adam and Eve are the only two people in the world, and all people came from them. Is that true?” [sighs] And this is weird. Like, you don’t know what to do, right? You want to be diplomatic. You don’t want to cause problems at school. But you gotta be honest. And one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is, “I don’t know.” I’m like, “Sweetie, I don’t know. I don’t know if Adam and Eve is where people came from. But nobody knows, because no one from today is alive back then. So it’s not something you can measure. So it’s not something you can see. So we don’t know. But here’s what we do know. You know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears?” “Yeah.” “Well, some people have brains that are made out of dog shit. And they get horny, too. And what happens is, they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with. It’s like the opposite of evolution. And then they have a kid, and their kid is f*cked. Their kid is f*cked! And everybody wants to pretend it’s a level playing field. There’s no level, anywhere you look. Is an eagle and a salmon level? Does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle? No. The universe does not want even! It wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement. Okay? I’m gonna shut this light out, and I’m gonna go f*ck your mom right in the mouth. All right?” I don’t say these things. I don’t say any of these things! I was like, “I don’t know. Maybe Debbie’s right. Doesn’t make sense to me. How would that work?” “How would that work?” “It wouldn’t work, would it?” Adam and Eve are the only two people. They have kids. And then, where do all the other people come from? I guess the kids just start f*cking each other. Is that what happens? Mom f*cks the kids, or the… Yeah, exactly.\\nDebbie’s parents. They were at my house, man, for a cookout, and the dude told me the Earth’s 10,000 years old. They’re Young Earth Christians. They’re sweet people, by the way. Before I shit on them… I’m gonna shit on them, but before I shit on them, they’re sweet. They’re really nice people. I hug ’em every time I see ’em. They’re really kind, nice people. But they just found a part of their brain, they’re like, “I have no use for this.” [grunts] Chucked that whole logic, discerning-reason part. “This f*cking thing’s confusing.” They’re Young Earth Christians, which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the Bible possible. I’m like, “How many people believe the Earth is less than 10,000 years old?” Uh! I looked it up. There’s a recent Gallup poll that said that 46% of America believes the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. [audience booing] Here’s why you shouldn’t be scared. They can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls. And when you factor that in, you’re talking about a really small number. ‘Cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say, “How old’s the Earth?” Number one answer is, “Older than your mother’s pussy.” And then they hang up. Number two answer is, “F*ck you!” After that, you start throwing numbers around. And only 46% of those dummies were stupid enough to think the Earth is 10,000 years old. That’s Debbie’s f*cking parents.\\nSo out of the people that answer polls… Is it even 1%? It might be 1%. Only 46% are that f*cking stupid. And that’s the 1% we should really be worried about. We’re worried about the wrong 1%. Not that we shouldn’t be worried about the really rich, greedy people. We definitely should. We should definitely worry about bankers and people who… They’re just stockpiling resources. They could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else. But they don’t. They’d rather just pile up their gold. [grunts] Yeah, that 1% is awful.\\nBut there’s another 1% that freaks me the f*ck out that no one’s talking about. That’s the 1% who leave comments on YouTube videos. Who the f*ck are those freaks? Could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other? I mean, if Jesus Christ himself came back from the dead and had a YouTube page, the first comment would be, “You ain’t shit without your dad, pussy.” These are monsters. This is not a normal person’s response. Normal people don’t leave comments. What a normal person does, they watch a video. They like it or they don’t like it. That’s it. It ends right there. But what you’re dealing with is the process of racism, and child abuse, and neglect and shitty genes. And the Insane Clown Posse is playing. They know all the words, and they’re wafting up their farts, and their Cheez Doodle fingers. And like, “An open letter to Jennifer Lopez… Let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick, here. [mimics fart] Ugh… Dear, Jennifer, don’t you think it’s about time you dress a little more classy? What are your children gonna see when they see…” Just f*cking think of the meanest, most biting shit that’s gonna cut it. As if Jennifer Lopez has time in between eating diamonds and f*cking all her background dancers in a castle that she built with her ass. But you know, “L',\n",
       "  'et me check the YouTube comments to see if my self-esteem’s on point. Oh!” And you know who’s dumber than them? Me. ‘Cause I read their shit and I get mad. I know they’re stupid. I still get upset. F*ck!\\nThis is the world, folks. This is the world we’re living in. Are we happy? I’m not sure.\\nIs this what we wanted? I don’t know.\\n[woman] No!\\nNo.\\n[woman] No!\\nAre you sure?\\n[woman] No!\\nWhy are you doing this? What is this? What are you doing? Are you fighting for freedom?\\nWhat’s happening?\\n[woman 2] No!\\nAre you White Panthers? What is this?\\n[man] Life sucks!\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are you saying?\\n[man] Life can kind of suck sometimes.\\nLife can kind of suck? Maybe it’s how you’re livin’ it, b*tch. “Life can kind of suck.” It’s the greatest time ever to be alive. “Yeah, I’d live in the old days when you could die from crabs.” It doesn’t get any better than today, man. So stupid. “Make America great again.” It’s as good as it’s ever been. What the f*ck are you saying? We have 4G everywhere. When has it been better? We have Netflix. When has it been better? Come on, man. Stop. It’s never been better. This is as good as it’s ever been. It’s just weird. It’s just weird. You gotta get your shit together, b*tch. Don’t blame the world. God damn it. Damn it, man. And listen, if you’ve seen any of this show, and you said, “I think some of the stuff you’re saying is really funny, but I sense a lot of, like, macho posturing from you. I sense a lot of, like, bullshit, tough-guy stuff.” You’re totally correct. And what it is is I live with all women, okay? And I’m becoming more of a b*tch every day of my life. And I just wanna say I’m not unhappy. I’ve never been more happy in my life. This is the happiest I’ve ever been. But when you’re with all girls, like, you have all girls all the time, you have to make little compromises. You don’t think about it while it’s happening. It’s like the rock doesn’t think about the water carving a path through it, but eventually, that f*cking path is gonna get deep. And when you’re with all people that are different than you, they just go, “Hmm…” They just start looking at you like little raptors testing the fence. [squawks] They’ll just start poking at you. It’s what people do. It’s natural. It’s just what people do. If you live with people that all are on AT&T and you’re on Verizon, they’re like, “Dude, look at my bars. Make the switch. Come on over. What are you, a f*cking Democrat, dude? Libertarian is where it’s at. Wake up! Join us!”\\nWhen you’re with all girls, they just start… They constantly f*ck with my manhood. It’s like, I’ll come home and some new thing is painted pink. I’m like, “Why is this pink?” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” “It looks better pink, Daddy.” And my wife’s like, “I think they’re right.” I’m like, “Oh… I see what the f*ck is going on here. It’s mutiny!” They just chip, chip, chip away. It’s like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles. Every day they steal two. They just walk up to my stack… You can’t say shit. You can’t say shit, ’cause it’s only two marbles, and you’re like, “I still got all these marbles. Everything is gonna be okay. I’ll deal with this eventually.” But you’re not gonna deal with it. Every day, two more marbles. You never get those marbles back. You see it comin’. You don’t do anything about it. You’re like, “I gotta go to sleep. All right, everybody stop crying. I gotta go to sleep.” And men don’t want to admit that. “Not me, bro. Not me, bro. I’d rather just live in the woods by myself.” What are you, a f*cking Coldplay song? Huh? What are you, a character in a book, you piece of shit?\\nNo one’s honest. No one’s honest about how much we need other people. That’s why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that don’t need people. The people who just walk away from it all, like, “Wow, what a rebel!” But in real life, we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement. So think about that. You’re in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers. And the worst shit they can do is leave you alone. We’re f*cking weird. We are weird, ’cause what we are really is we’re some weird superorganism that, like, needs each other in some sort of strange way. But we’re all in denial. “I’m kind of a loner.” Oh, shut the f*ck up. There’s no such thing. It’s not real. Every person in this room, me included, all of us, we are all a calculation. We’re all an ongoing, on-running calculation of all the interactions you’ve ever had with all the people that you’ve ever met. And you do a bunch of things that people like, and start doing more of that. You’re like, “I’ll do more of that.” You find things that people don’t like, you’re like, “I’ll keep that shit to myself, hmm. I don’t like that feeling. Hmm.” That’s what we do. That’s what we do. It’s weird. We don’t want to admit it. But that’s who we all are. And I’m just telling you this because I’ve never been more of a b*tch. Right now, I have slowly but surely bent until I’m in this position. This is how I’m riding out my days, just like this. “Okay, okay, okay, okay.”\\nBut I’m also telling you right now that I’m not going out like Bruce Jenner. Oh! That’s right, politically correct San Francisco. Here’s my take on this Bruce Jenner thing. And, you know, everybody has their own… Not really. This is what everybody’s take is. This is the take that you’re supposed to have. “He’s always been a woman trapped in a man’s body.” Maybe. Definitely maybe. Definitely people are like that. Definitely, there are people who were born in the wrong gender. And am I saying they should stay their gender? No. Who gives a f*ck? You should do whatever you wan',\n",
       "  'na do. You should be happy. You should be free. I don’t care what you do. But… it’s also possible that, maybe, if you live with crazy b*tches long enough, you become one. That’s all I’m saying. I don’t see this discussed. It is entirely possible. If you put a praying mantis on a leaf, it becomes the color of the leaf. Why? Because it wants to live. It wants to survive. It wants to be accepted by its environment. You show me a man who’s lived with the Kardashians for ten years who didn’t come out a chick, and then we’ll have some data, okay? ‘Cause right now, we lost a f*cking American Olympian, and I want you to have some respect!\\nWe’re down Bruce Jenner. And I’ve got a close eye on Kanye West, and I don’t exactly like what I’m seeing. [audience applauding and cheering] Look at Kanye West. He’s a very talented, young, heterosexual man who starts a clothing line… he’s clearly jealous about Taylor Swift, and he tweets like a coked-up stripper in the middle of the night. You don’t see what I’m seeing? We are watching the plot of a f*cking Stephen King book play out!\\nAn American athletic hero moves in with a woman who’s made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone. He breaks up with her. She turns him into a chick. The whole world tells him he’s beautiful. You tell me you don’t see what I’m seeing? You have to say… You have to say she’s beautiful. “She’s beautiful.” She’s not beautiful, and neither am I. Look, I look like a thumb with two thumbs. Okay? You put me in a dress, I’d be even more disgusting. “Beauty’s unusual.” There’s a lot of cool shit that isn’t beautiful. Sixty-year-old dudes in skirts are on that list. Jesus f*cking Christ! What kind of games are we playing here? Why are you lying to children? That’s beautiful. What are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose? “Is that beautiful too, Daddy? Explain.” Ahhh! Bang! I can’t! The world’s gone f*cking bananas! “What you’re saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive. You should be embarrassed at what you’re doing. You’re doing this just to get laughs at someone else’s expense.” Maybe! Or maybe Bruce Jenner lived with demons. Maybe they waited by the bed… until they knew he was in heavy REM sleep… so they could assume their true form. [squawking] Climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black raven’s claws. Clutched the edge of the bed and just… whispered in his ear. [snarls] [imitating demon] “Bruce… [breathing heavily] we would like you better if you were one of us.” “[groaning] I can’t. I can’t be one of you. I was… I was born a man.” “Nonsense! [snarling] [hissing] Nonsense. Bruce… you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth. You’re free. Bruce… [snarling] your lips are too thin… for the cover of Vanity Fair.” “Huh? What? Wait. Wait. Did you say the cover? Okay. Are you f*cking with me? Because… you know the cover’s always been my dream.” “It can be real! [snarls] It can be real. All dreams… can be real through surgery. Sleep.”\\n[audience cheering and applauding]\\nThank you very much, San Francisco! I had a great f*cking time with you savages! Let’s take a selfie. Shit. We got it. Putting together one of these f*cking specials is stressful as shit. I appreciate the f*ck out of all you people being here tonight. And I love you guys. Thank you very much!\\n[cheering and applauding continues]\\n[rock music playing]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nJoe Rogan, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Wish me luck out there. You will die on August 7th, 2037. That’s pretty good. All right. Hello. Hello, Chicago. Nice to see you again. Thank you. That was very nice. Thank you. Look, now, you’re a wonderful crowd, but I need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? Because… No, no, no. Thank you. Some crowds… some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. So… I don’t judge those crowds, by the way, okay? We’ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. We’ve all made a “Happy Birthday” sign… Wait. You get that poster board up, and you’re like, “I don’t need to trace it. I know how big letters should be. To begin with, a big-ass ‘H’. Followed by a big-ass ‘A’ and… Oh, no! Oh, God! Okay, all right. Real skinny ‘P’ with a high hump, and then we’ll put the second ‘P’ below the hump of that first ‘P’, sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. And now I have no room for the ‘Y’, so I’ll do a kind of curled-up noodle ‘Y’. Block letters and cursive look good together.” And then you go to write “Birthday” and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with “Happy.” You’re like, “Yeah, but the past is the past. Big-ass ‘B’. Surely more letters will fit in the same space.”\\nYou’re very friendly here in Chicago. I mean, we’re all violent here, but you’re very friendly. No, really. And I don’t like confrontation, ’cause I’ve never been in a fight before. Though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment I walked out on stage. I don’t give off that vibe. Some people give off a vibe of… Right away, they’re like, “Do not fuck with me.” My vibe is more like, “Hey, you could pour soup in my lap and I’ll probably apologize to you.” When I walk, for real, my feet go out like this. I’m so open and vulnerable. I look like a doll that you point out molestation on. “Show us on this white comedian where the man touched you.”\\nIt’s been a while since I’ve been home to Chicago. I got married since then. Thank you. I married my wife. I love saying “my wife.” It sounds so adult. “That’s my wife.” It’s great, you sound like a person. I said it even before we were married. We were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and Anna’s ticket didn’t say anything and my ticket said “priority access.” It doesn’t matter why. But we were getting on and I said, “Uh, can my wife board with me?” And they were like, “Yes, of course. Right this way.” And I was like, “Oh, that is so much better than all those times I was like, ‘Can my girlfriend come?\\'” And, yeah, I shouldn’t have said it that way, but still. “My wife” just has some kick-ass to it, you know? “Get away from my wife! No one talk to my wife!” Marriage is gonna be very magical. “I didn’t kill my wife!” That’s like, “Ooh, who’s that fella? I bet he did kill his wife.” Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. That’s not really a joke, that’s just a little sweet thing I like to say. ‘Cause I’d been in relationships where I got cheated on, like, long ones. I don’t know if you’ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. ‘Cause when I was a kid, I used to watch America’s Most Wanted. You know how kids do. And I would always think to myself, “How could another person kill someone? How could a human being kill another human being?” And then I got cheated on, and I was like, “Oh, okay.” “I’m not gonna do it, but I totally get it.” And I don’t mean in that way of, like, “No one else can have you.” I don’t care about that. It’s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. They have a lot of information. Anyone who’s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. I can’t have them roaming around.\\nI talked to a lot of people before I got engaged, you know. And I heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. This is an old expression. People say this. They say, “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free',\n",
       "  '?” You ever heard that before? It’s a bananas insulting expression… to an entire gender. But also, it makes no sense. “Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?” You’re not allowed to milk a cow that you don’t own. That’s not even a situation. Was that a problem at one point? Like, in the dairy community? Was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? Some Dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, “Ah-ha-ha, I take your milk.” And the farmer was like, “Well, then, this is your cow now.” And he was like, “No, no proof of purchase.” And he ran off into the night. That sounded Dutch, right? You know what that… you know what that expression means? It means, “Why would you marry a woman if she’s already having sex with you?” Which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. Now, it’s like, “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you’re gonna buy it. And… … you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you can’t avoid that question at all. And also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. And the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. “Why buy the cow?” Uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like… And does not enjoy the sale at all… even though she’s the one that wanted to go to the sale. And she’s especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. “Why buy the cow?” Well, let’s be real here. You’re very lucky to have the cow that you do have. “Roping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, John.” By the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and… a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought… They assume it. When you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, “John Mulaney bull?” And if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. They’ll still say it. ‘Cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but… But, for real, Chicago, why buy the cow? Let’s be real. Why buy the cow? Because you love her. You really do. And, yeah, yeah… Sure, she’s a bossy little Jew, but… … she takes care of you. And you don’t wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, “Hey, you seen any loose milk?”\\nMy wife is Jewish. She’s a New York Jew. I did it! Now, I was raised Catholic. I don’t know if you can tell that from the everything about me. My wife is Jewish, I grew up Catholic, so we got married by a friend. Being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families’ religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. “What’s the name of the bishop?” “That’s actually stand-up comedian Dan Levy. He was the host of MTV’s Your Face or Mine?” I saw a lot of Catholic weddings, though, because I was an altar boy… And a hush falls over the room. Isn’t it weird how that became a scandalous thing? That was just some boring shit I had to do on weekends. But now, it’s like saying, “I was a French maid for a period of time. I was treated well in my day. I worked for a variety of sirs.” No, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? You’d serve Mass and then you’d serve weddings sometimes. My brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in Chicago where we grew up. And the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, “Aw, she’s ugly.” And then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. And I know that’s awful, but wouldn’t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? It was the best moment of this stupid woman’s life, and she’s walking down the aisle, and the organ’s like… And she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of God. And right at that second, for no reason at all, some Cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, 13-year-old prick decides to go, “Aw, she’s ugly!” Hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, “Aw, she’s beautiful. She’s enchanting.”\\nI grew up Catholic. I don’t go to church anymore. But I went on Christmas Eve with my parents, ’cause you know how you lie to your parents. So… we go into the church and I was like, “I got this under control.” And then I got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. No, I was going through Mass and I was batting, like, .400. And then in the middle of Mass, the priest said, “Peace be with you.” And everyone said, “And with your spirit.” And I was the one pre-Y2K asshole going, “And also with you. What? Huh? What? Huh? What? When? When?” For those of you that aren’t Catholic, I don’t mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but… There’s a part in church where the priest says, “Peace be with you.” And for many, many years, w',\n",
       "  \"e all said… – “And also with you.” – Very good. But they changed it to “And with your spirit.” Because that’s what needed revamping in the Catholic Church. That was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. In Rome, they were like, “Let’s see. What problems can we solve? Problem one. No.” I’m actually glad they changed that, though. I never liked “And also with you.” I always found that clunky. “And also with you.” That’s not how you talk. – “Have a nice day.” – “And also you having one.” It’s just a little bit wrong, isn’t it? It’s just a little off. Like, when someone’s like, “How are you?” And you’re like, “Nothing much.” And it sort of makes sense. Never begin a sentence with “And also.” You just immediately sound caught off-guard. It sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren’t expecting it. Like, the priest was like, “Hey, this is the first time we’ve ever had church. I just wanna say, ‘Peace be with you.'” And they were like… “What? Oh. Uh, yeah. And also you should have some.” “Hey, that’s good. Let’s keep that for 2,000 years. And then change it to trick John.”\\nMy wife and I don’t have any children, we have a dog. We have a little puppy named Petunia. She’s a tiny little French bulldog puppy. I like having a puppy that’s a bulldog, ’cause it’s like having a baby that is also a grandma. Her body is young, her face is as old as time. She definitely saw the Nazis march into Paris. She always gives me this look of like, “Oh, the things I have seen, you cocksucker. You have no idea. The Gestapo threw my printing press into a river. But, go, tell your fucking jokes. Bring me my dish.” She said that. Petunia… Petunia is my best friend in the world. I give her a million kisses a day. She does not like me, and barks at me and bites me all day long. We had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because Petunia is a bad dog. We tell her that every day. We go, “Hey, you’re bad at being a dog.” So, the trainer came into the apartment. Sorry, didn’t even walk into the apartment, walked into the threshold and went, “Oh, okay.” Like she was an exorcist or something. She said, “I see what the problem is.” She said, “Petunia has become the alpha of the house.” And then she pointed at me, she said, “You are no longer the alpha of the house.” And in the back of my head, I was like, “I was never the alpha of the house.” I turned to my wife, I was like, “Let’s pretend. It’ll be fun. Yes… My title of alpha, which I once had, how can I reclaim it? Because that was a thing that existed at one time.” She said, “You need to show dominance over your puppy.” These are things people say to me. I said, “How do I do that?” She said, “Well, let me ask you this. Who eats dinner first, you or Petunia?” I was like, “Petunia eats dinner first. She eats dinner at 5:00 p.m., ’cause she’s a foot long and two years old.” She said, “No, you need to eat dinner first. Because the king eats before anyone else eats.” Oh, yes, and what a mighty king I will be, eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon. “Look upon your sovereign, Petunia, and tremble. My lands stretch across this entire one bedroom, and I eat dinner whenever I choose, as long as it works for the schedule of a dog.” She said, “Now, you don’t actually have to eat dinner before Petunia. You just have to convince Petunia that you’ve already eaten.” So… for the past month, I shit you not… before my wife and I give Petunia her dish, we take down empty bowls and spoons, and in front of her, we go, “Mmm, dinner. Mmm, good dinner.” Like we’re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote, but they didn’t work that hard on. “Mmm, we’re eating dinner.” Meanwhile, Petunia’s just staring at us with her Paul Giamatti face, like… “You’re not eating dinner, cocksucker. Dish, now.”\\nI have a wife and a dog, and we just bought a house. We have a new house. It was built in the ’20s, but it was flipped in 2014. Which means it’s haunted, but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash. Actually, we didn’t buy a house. A bank bought a house, and I’m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while I pay it off for 30 years. The woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years. And she said, “So, for instance, this is what you’ll pay in July of 2029.” And I burst out laughing. I was like, “2029? That’s not a real year. By 2029, I’ll be drinking moon juice with President Jonathan Taylor Thomas. I’m not gonna be writing you a paper check.” I like having a house, but I loved looking for a house, ’cause I love real estate agents. I mean, they are the true heroes. They really are. Have you ever watched HGTV? Real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives. Every episode of HGTV is like, “Craig and Stacia are looking for a two-story A-frame that’s near Craig’s job in the downtown, but also satisfies Stacia’s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near Craig’s job. With three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of $7… let’s see what Lori Jo can do on this week’s episode of You Don’t Deserve A Beach House.”\\nI loved our real estate agent. It was so fun to h\",\n",
       "  'ang out with her. It was like hanging out with my mom. ‘Cause, you know, real estate agents always look like your mom. And they have various Chico’s accoutrements. They always have kind of fun mom energy. And they’re always, “So excited to see you two.” We would have little conferences before we walked into a house. She’d go, “Let’s talk. Let’s talk before we go in.” We’re, like, two feet from the door. “So, there’s no toilets. And I know that was on your list. But I think I can get him to budge. Let’s go.” So, we’d have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent who’s just some guy sitting in a big chair. And these two always hated each other. They’d be like, “Hi, Tony.” “Hi, Kim.” It’s like, “Jesus Christ! What, were you two in the Eagles together? What is the animosity about?” Our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. She hinted about it constantly. Every room she walked into, she’d be like, “So, this could be an office.” “Or maybe a nursery.” “Yeah. No, like we said, we don’t know if we’re gonna have… ” “No, no. I know, I know, you know. You don’t know if you’re gonna have ’em, but you know. You know, you never know. Sometimes you don’t know what’s gonna happen, and then… you know, something happens.” “Well, yeah, that’s how all of life works.” “Okay, all right. Okay. Uh-huh. Mmm. This is an on-fire garbage can. Could be a nursery.” She showed me a backyard once. She goes, “I don’t even like this backyard for you.” I was like, “Oh, do tell.” She said, “It’s all pavement. I think you should have some grass out there. You know, in case you have a couple… little guys… running around in the grass.” And I got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. I was like, “Hey, lady. I went outside about as much as Powder from the movie Powder. My children are not gonna be playing out on grass. They will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. These are my children. And that’s my wife!”\\nI didn’t mean to make it sound like we don’t want children. We don’t, but I didn’t mean to make it sound like that. See, I just don’t think babies like me very much. Sometimes babies will point at me, and I don’t care for that shit at all. Like, I’ll be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one Cheerio with Bobby Fischer-like intensity. And it’ll look up at me and go… I like to lean in and go, “Stop snitchin’, motherfucker.” And then walk off. ‘Cause you’re never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. My friends have babies and I don’t do so well with them. I had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. I know there are better ways to start that story, but… My friend, Jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and I really like her. She’s a sweet kid. I really like his daughter a lot. But I was over at his family’s house for the Fourth of July, and he had his daughter on his knee. And it was a very lovely day. His whole extended family was there. And he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, “Do you know who that is? That’s your Uncle John.” And I was like, “Oh, my God. That’s so sweet. I’m her Uncle John.” And then the baby pointed at me and said, “Uncle John has a penis.” I thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! Fell deadly silent, is what they all did. Hey, do you know what you’re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, “He has a penis”? No, I’m asking, ’cause I don’t know what to say in that situation. Here’s what I went with that day. I said, “Oh, come on!” I don’t know. I thought that’d be good. But then it just made it worse, ’cause it sounded like the baby and I had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. Like, the baby had been like, “Do you have a penis?” And I was like, “Yes, I do, but you’re a baby, so discretion is key.” And then the next day she goes, “He has a penis,” and I go, “Oh, come on! Someone can’t keep a secret!” Luckily, Jeremy’s wife saved the day. The baby’s mom saved the day. She came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, “It’s okay. She’s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot.” Aren’t we all? And, by the way, it would’ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. Like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, “She has a vagina,” the woman could be like, “Yes, I do, and it’s magnificent.” And we would all be like, “Hooray! You are brave!” No one wants to applaud the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo.\\nIt’s fun to be married. I’ve never been supervised before. I’m supervised. She studies what I do. Like an anthropologist. She’ll be like, “Sometimes, he will watch a movie on TV even though he already owns that movie on DVD. Pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him.” I had no supervision when I was a kid. We were free to do what we wanted. But also, with that, no one cared about kids. I grew up before children were special. I did. Very early ’80s, right before children became specia',\n",
       "  'l. Like, I remember when milk carton kids became a thing. When they were like, “Hey, we should start looking for some of these guys. I don’t think they’re just blowing off steam.” No one cared about my opinion when I was a little kid. No one cared what I thought. Sometimes, people would say, “What do you think you’re doing?” But that just meant “Stop.” They didn’t actually wanna know my thought process. They didn’t want me to be like, “Well, I was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when I lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere.” “Oh, well, that’s very interesting. And what brought you to this experiment?” “Oh, well, thank you for asking. Well… you know how I’m filled with rage? I’m so horny and angry all the time… and I have no outlet for it. So… eggs.” Your opinion doesn’t matter in elementary school either. It matters in college. College is just your opinion. Just you raising your hand and being like, “I think Emily Dickinson’s a lesbian.” And they’re like, “Partial credit.” And that’s a whole thing. But in elementary school, it doesn’t matter what you think, it just matters what you know. You have to have answers to questions. And if you say, “I don’t know,” you get an X on your test, and you get it wrong and that’s not fair, ’cause your brain has never been smaller. Also, that’s not how life works. I’m in my 30s now. If you came to me now and you were like, “Hey, John, name three things that the Stamp Act of 1775 accomplished.” I’d go, “I don’t know. Get out of my apartment,” you know? But when you’re a little kid, you can’t say, “I don’t know.” You should be able to. That should be an acceptable answer on a test. You should be able to write in, “I don’t know. I know you told me. But I have had a very long day. I am very small. And I have no money. So you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under.” Or if it’s one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, “Who’s to say?” Kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. Like, that’s the biggest civil rights increase I’ve seen in my lifetime. The rights of children have gone through the roof. I had no rights when I was a little kid. I remember, one time, I walked into a supermarket by myself, and I walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, “No!” And I went, “All right.” And I turned around and left. That’s how broken I was.\\nAnd there weren’t special things for kids the way there are now. Like, we would just go see movies. Any movie. Like Back to the Future. That was a movie everyone could see. Kids could kinda see it. Great movie, right? I rewatched it recently. It’s a very weird movie. Marty McFly is a 17-year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. And, I shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. They never explain it. Not even in a lazy way, like, “Hey, remember when we met in the science building?” They don’t even do that. And we were all fine with it. We were just like, “What, who’s his best friend? A disgraced nuclear physicist? All right, proceed.” What a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. Two guys had to go in and do that. They had to be like, “Okay… we got an idea… for the next big family-action-comedy. All right, it’s about a guy named Marty, and he’s very lazy. He’s always sleeping late.” “Okay. Is he cool like Ferris Bueller?” “No. But he does have this best friend who’s, you know, a disgraced… nuclear physicist.” “I’m confused here. This best friend, this is another student?” “No, no, no. No, this guy’s either, like, 40 or 80. Even we don’t know how old this guy’s supposed to be. But one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. Whoa!” “Okay. I think I see where you’re going here. They build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the Kennedy assassination.” “Ah! Oh, wow, that’s a really good idea, I mean, we didn’t even think of that.” “All right, well, what do they do with the time machine?” “Well, now I’m embarrassed to say. Ah, well, all right, all right, all right. We thought… We thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom.” “I don’t know. We thought that’d be fun for people. But, no, good point. No, he doesn’t get to, he doesn’t get to. ‘Cause this family friend named Biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. The dad’s gotta beat the rapist off of her. And also, we’re gonna imply that a white man wrote ‘Johnny B. Goode.’ So, we’re gonna take that away from ’em.” “Well, this is the best movie idea I have ever heard in my life. We’re gonna make three of them. Now, you say they go to the past. How about we call it Back to the Past?” “No, no, no. Back to the Future.” “Right, but they go to the past.” “Yeah.”\\nKids have it very good now. My friend’s a teacher. She told me that, uh… the parents will take the kids’ side over the teacher now. That’s insane. That never happened. My parents trusted every grown-up… more than they trusted me. I don’t m',\n",
       "  \"ean coaches and teachers. Any human adult’s word… was better than mine. Any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, “Excuse me! Your kid bit my dick.” And my mom would be like, “John Edmund Mulaney, did you bite this nice man’s dick?” And I would be the only one who’s like, “Hey, doesn’t anyone wanna know why… his dick was near my biters… in the first place? Isn’t anyone curious… as to how I had access?” Don’t get me wrong, my parents love us. They just didn’t like us. We weren’t friends. People are now like, “My mom’s my best friend.” I was like, “Oh, is she a super bad mom?” My parents didn’t trust us, and they shouldn’t have trusted us. We were little goblins. We were terrible. I remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. Three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, “All right, we’re going to a resort, and I’ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm.” And we were like, “Oh, yes! Yay! Yes!” “Now, I’m telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm.” “Oh, we’re gonna freak out so bad!” “Yes, John, you have a question?” “How did he lose his arm?” “That’s exactly what you won’t ask.” And then I did ask. I went into the kitchen one day, and I was like, “So, how’d you lose your arm?” And he was like, “Well, I was born with only one arm.” And I was like, “Nah.”\\nNo, my parents loved us. It’s just, like, they were the cops, you know? And we were criminals. So, we didn’t get along. We only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. Like, when my dad and I would talk, it was like that scene in the movie Heat, when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino sit down in that diner. We kind of had that rapport of, like, “Hmm, we’re not so different, you and I. You have your law practice, and me, I have all these fucking markers.” “I guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way.” My dad would respect it if I could get away with breaking a rule. We had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch TV on a school night. So, every school night, I would 100% be watching TV. And I would hear my dad coming, I would immediately turn the TV off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. And I’d open it and pretend to be doing homework. My dad would walk in the room and he would go, “What are you doing? Are you watching TV?” And I’d go, “No, man. I’m not watching TV.” And the TV wouldn’t even be dark yet. It would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. It’d be sizzling like a glass of Pepsi. And I would look my dad in the eyes and go, “No, I’m just reading this Yellow Pages.”\\nMy dad loved us. He just didn’t care about our general happiness or self-esteem. I remember, one time, we were really little kids. I have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to Wisconsin. My dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. ‘Cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? You remember that era? Where we were like, “How much wood can we get on this car… without it catching on fire?” But then the big announcement. “We here at Plymouth-Chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times you’ve looked at your minivan and thought, ‘Huh! It needs a belt.'” So, we’re going on the highway. We’ve been on the road for three hours. And in the distance, we see a McDonald’s. We see the golden arches. And we got so excited. We started chanting, “McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s! McDonald’s!” And my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. And then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. And kept driving. And, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. How perfect is that? He had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. The one thing from McDonald’s no child could enjoy. My dad is cold-blooded. He once shushed a kid during Lion King on Broadway. That actually happened. We were at Lion King on Broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, “Look, it’s Pumbaa! Look, it’s Timon!” And my dad turned around and said, “Are you going to talk the entire time?” He’s my hero.\\nThe weirdest thing when I was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. They scared us about it constantly. And I’ve been on tour this year… Marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another. It’s insane. Yeah, well… All right, don’t “whoo” if you’re white. It’s always been legal for us. Come on, sir. We don’t go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy. When I was arrested with a one-hitter at a Rusted Root concert, I did not serve hard time. I think I got an award. Eighteen or 19 states. And, by the way, I agree, it’s a very good thing. But it’s also a really weird thing, because this is the first time I’ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like, “Fine.” You know? I’ve never seen it before. Like, gay ma\",\n",
       "  'rriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the Supreme Court, and be like, “Gay people are humans.” And they’re like, “We’ll think about it.” But with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for 40 years, like, “Excuse me.” And then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and they’re just like, “Okay, here. Take a little. We’d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else… blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.” Those stupid parents. And that’s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. It would be on our sitcoms. We’d be watching Saved by the Bell, we’d be having a great old time. And then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. And they’d always hold the joint… The bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. They’d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. Like it’s a skull in a Shakespeare play. And now it’s legal, and that is great news. Unless you’re a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. And I don’t just mean because they’re about to lose out to Amazon.com. I more feel bad for weed dealers ’cause they’re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. And we don’t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. Like, when the Chinese food delivery guy comes, we don’t let him hang out after he’s delivered the Chinese food. And we don’t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we’re hanging out with… to try to preserve the relationship. And we definitely don’t give him some of the Chinese food. He’s never like, “Hey, can I get in on those dumplings?” And we’re like, “Yeah, we’re all friends.”\\nWhat are you, on your phone? Hey, V-neck. Hey! – What’s your name? – Sam. Sam? Cool! What do you do to afford V-necks, Sam? Typing numbers. Ah… numbers, the letters of math. I’m sorry to bother you. I don’t mean to single you out. I hate when people get pulled out of the audience. Like, are you familiar with the Cirque du Soleil, Sam? They’re a group of French assholes that are slowly taking over America by humiliating audience members one by one. We once went to see Cirque du Soleil at Navy Pier when I was a kid, and my brother came, and he was 12 years old. You remember being 12, when you’re like, “No one look at me or I’ll kill myself.” And these French bastards come into the crowd, being like, “Le volunteer!” And they pulled my brother up on stage, and I was like, “No!” And they brought him up, and they reached into his sweatshirt, and they were like… And they had planted a bra, and they pulled out a bra and they were like… And everyone at Navy Pier was like “Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha!” And my brother was like, “That’s great!” I have had other jobs besides comedy.\\nI was an office temp for a while. I really miss that. I loved being a temp, because I would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week. And then you just get to retire like Lou Gehrig. You’re like, “Thank you. No one will ever see me again.” And they’re like, “Goodbye!” I worked at an office once on 57th Street in New York City. I was there for a couple weeks. I was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. This woman named Mischa sat in the other cubicle. I want to get the number right. I think Mischa had… about 900,000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. Almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, A Beautiful Mind-style. I think about Mischa two times a week… because of a phone call she had next to me one day. It was one of my first days, and I was sitting next to her. And her phone rang, and this was her call, and I’m quoting. Her phone rang and she said, “Hello? Hush!” And then she hung up. Think about that two times a week. And I didn’t know her well enough by then to be like, “Hey, what kind of a person are you?” You know? Who could she have been talking to? “Hello? Hush!” This was a place of business. My only thought was that it was the CEO of the company being like, “Mischa, help. I’m doing a crossword puzzle. I need a four-letter word for ‘be quiet’ right now.” – “Hush!” – “You’re promoted.”\\nI temped at a little web company on 25th Street in New York City. It was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money New York. His name was Henry J. Finch IV. Like old, old, old money. Like, his money was in molasses or something. He owned this web company. I have no idea why he owned this web company. I think he won it in a rich man’s game of dice and small binoculars, or something. Mr. Finch wore linen suits. He had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. I’m giving you more description than you need, ’cause I need you to believe me. This was a real person I knew in the 21st century. Mr. Finch was in his 70s. He had an assistant named Mary. She was in her 50s, she was Korean. I don’t know why he had an assistant. He did not need one. Unless he needed someone to be like, “Remember, Mr. Finch, at five o’clock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled ',\n",
       "  \"egg.” One day, Mr. Finch came into the office. It had been raining. Everything I’m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. Mr. Finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. And he walked in and he said, and I’m quoting, “Ah! One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” And then Mary yelled, “Ooh, ducklings!” To which Mr. Finch replied, “Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack.” And then walked into his office. I think about that every goddamn day. I mean, imagine you’re me. You’re a 22-year-old temp, and you’re so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. And then that happens in front of you, and I don’t know, gives you hope? And I did that a little fast. Let me break that conversation down for you. Mr. Finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. “Ah!” “One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!” The rain. “And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!” Now, that’s debatable. But rather than debate that point, Mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point… which was, “Ducklings!” But Mr. Finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality… said, “Ah, too old to be a duckling!” As if to say, “My duckling days are behind me. Mary, don’t you see? I’m a duck now. And to prove it… Well, I’ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has… ‘Quack, quack.'” And I knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to Mr. Finch, what he had said. Crazy people are like that. They have unlimited crazy currency. Like, if I had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, “Hey, Finch, you remember that time you were like, ‘Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack’?” He would just be like, “Ah, perhaps I did quack! But such is life for an old knickerbocker like me.” Like, he’d say something else crazy.\\nThat’s the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? Is that they just have unlimited currency. The things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. I was once walking into Penn Station in New York. I was walking down 31st Street towards Eighth Avenue. I’m walking down 31st, there’s this woman standing at Eighth and 31st. I have my little roller suitcase. You can all imagine. I’m walking towards her. She’s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. She’s watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had Terminator vision… where she could see little bits of data, like, “Little honky ass,” and could read information. As I walked past her, she said this to me. I walked past her and she said, and I’m quoting, “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” Very dirty, yes? A very upsetting thing to hear, yes? I’m sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. I was alone out there that afternoon. And she said this totally unprompted. “Eat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.” It wasn’t like I had paused in front of her and been like, “What should I do with my life?” So, I walk away from her with this to-do list. And I like structure, I like a to-do list. It did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. ‘Cause it starts in a pretty rough place. It starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. But by the end, you have your own small business. And isn’t that the American dream when all’s said and done? That if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. Imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, “But I…” This has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. I just wanna say that in all sincerity. Thanks for coming to this. Really, really appreciate it.\\nI wanna tell you one more story before I get out of here, about the night I met a guy named Bill Clinton. Now, I don’t… Some of you know who that is? For those of you that don’t, he was President of the United States from 1993 until 2001, and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared Emperor of the United States of America. Now, I know you know who Bill Clinton is. But I was doing a show at a college, and I mentioned Bill Clinton, and, like, they kind of didn’t know who he was. Like, sorry, they knew the name, right? But they only knew this 2015 Bill Clinton, who’s a very different Bill Clinton. Have you seen his ass lately? What the hell is he trying to pull? He’s all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and he’s got these grandpa reading glasses, like, “Hey, I can’t do nothing to nobody no more.” “Oh, me? I’m just an old, old man. I don’t have the appetites.” You know? And he’s always flying around the world with Bill Gates trying to cure AIDS.\\nThat is not the Bill Clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago. Our Bill Clinton was like a big, fat Buddy Garrity from Friday Night Lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on Arsenio, and his work in the STD community was not in curing anything at that time. That was the man we all elected president. That was the Bill Clinton that I met. I got to meet Bill \",\n",
       "  'Clinton when he was Governor Clinton in 1992, when he was first running for president.\\nAnd I got to meet Bill Clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as Bill Clinton. They’re a little younger, but they went to the same college. So, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. Now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. One, I got to meet Bill Clinton. But two, I got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. And that is super funny to see, ’cause think about some of the people you went to school with. Now imagine they’re becoming the president. Imagine Sam was becoming the president. It would stir up strong emotions. And my parents had very different opinions on Bill Clinton.\\nMy mom loved Bill Clinton, ’cause Bill Clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. I mean, think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like Frank Caliendo doing John Madden. Now… imagine him as a college student. And my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. That sounds good, right? So, my mom tells me that Bill Clinton would be out in front of the library every single night… just being like, “Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home?” And one night, my mom was leaving the library, and Bill Clinton was like, “Hey, can I walk ya home?” And my mom was like, “Hell, yes.” So… This is absolutely true. My mom, little Ellen Stanton, walked arm-in-arm with Bill Clinton to her dorm. And she was like, “You know, I wanted to invite him up for a beer.” And I was like, “Thanks, I’m nine.” But… her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with Bill Clinton.\\nNow, my dad, on the other hand, hated Bill Clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. And also, my dad’s a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. He always told me that he hated it in college that Bill Clinton could, quote, “Get away with anything.” Can you imagine how he felt later?\\nSo, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet Bill Clinton. My mom opens it first and she goes, “Oh, we have to go. We have to go see Bill.” And without looking up at her, my dad just says, “Why? It’s not like he’s gonna remember you.” One black coffee. Same motherfucker. So, my mom says, “Fine! I’ll go and I’ll take John.” And I was like, “Hell, yeah.” And I slid in the room in my First Communion suit, ready to go. ‘Cause I loved Bill Clinton. I was ten years old. If you were a kid when Bill Clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. We’d never seen a cool politician before. And he would go on MTV, and he’d have cool answers to kids’ questions. They’d be like, “Governor, what’s your favorite food?” And he’d be like, “I don’t know, fries?” And we’d be like, “Yay, we eat fries!”\\nI learned to play his campaign song on the piano. It was “Don’t Stop” by Fleetwood Mac… from Rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. He let us know who he was right away. So, I went with my mom, as her date… to reconnect with Governor Bill Clinton. We walked into the ballroom. It was a big hotel ballroom. It was the Palmer House Hilton, big Hilton hotel ballroom. Walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. It’s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie The Fugitive, remember? So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people, the… Sorry, the end where Harrison Ford, as Dr. Richard Kimble, bursts in to confront Dr. Charles Nichols, right? Okay. So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it’s packed with people. Why does Kimble confront Nichols? Well, I know we all know this, but… No, no. But, but, but… Kimble, he found out that Nichols, along with Devlin MacGregor and Lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired Frederick Sykes, the one-armed man, to kill Kimble. Kimble’s wife wasn’t even the target. I know we all know this. But they were gonna kill Kimble because he wasn’t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass RUD-90. So, Kimble finds out about all of this, and, of course, he’s furious. And he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, “You switched the samples!” And Dr. Nichols is like, “Ladies and gentlemen, my friend, Dr. Richard Kimble.” What accent did that guy have, by the way? He goes, “You switched the samples! And you doctored your research! So that you could have Provasic!”\\nAnyway, so it’s that ballroom. So, we walk into that ballroom. It was packed with people. It was packed with people. A real Who’s Not of Chicago celebrities. Walter Jacobson was there. Walter Jacobson was the local Fox anchor. He’d do fun things where he’d go undercover as a homeless person. And he’d be like, “Oh, what time is the soup?” And they’d be like, “Man, you’re Walter Jacobson.” He was there. Everybody. And on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we s',\n",
       "  'aw a little bit of silver hair. And it was him… Bill Clinton. The Comeback Kid. But he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and Secret Service. So, what are you gonna do? Well, if you’re my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. And then you start jogging while yelling, “This ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the United States!” Kind of implying that I might be dying. My feet were not on the ground. She was swinging me like a snowplow. I was just mowing down fat Chicago Democrats. I pushed past all the reporters, I pushed past all the photographers. We pushed past all the Secret Service.\\nWe land at Bill Clinton’s feet. Bill Clinton turns, looks at my mom and says, “Hey, Ellen,” ’cause he never forgets a bitch, ever. My mom melts. She goes, “Hi, Bill.” Then it is revealed that she has no plan. So… she pushes me towards Clinton and she goes, “This is my son, John, and he’s also going to be president.” And I was like, “What the hell are you talking about? I’m not gonna be president.” And I know now that I’m definitely never gonna be president. Not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. Based on my ten-year-old memory, Bill Clinton is about 13 feet tall. And he leaned down, because, well, I was wearing this button that I bought outside the fundraiser. It was a cartoon button of George H. W. Bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. And it said, “Bird-brained.” And I thought it was very funny. And Bill Clinton leaned down so that only I could hear and he said, “Hey, man, I like your button.” And I said, “You can do whatever you want forever.” And he took my advice. And… it was the best night of my entire life.\\nAnd I got home that night… I got home that night, and my dad was still awake, like, reading angry under one lamp, just like… And I went up to him and I went, “Hey! I’m gonna be a Democrat.” “And I’m gonna vote for Bill Clinton.” And without looking up at me, my dad just said, “You have the moral backbone of a chocolate éclair.” You know, how you talk to a child. So, here’s the end of that story. That was 1992.\\nLet’s flash forward five years to 1997. It is now 1997. I am a sophomore in high school, Bill Clinton is in his second term as president. And on the morning that the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of The New York Times. It had been on the Drudge Report, and then it was on the cover of The New York Times. That morning, I wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. I am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach. And I open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work, and he says, “The other shoe just dropped.” And then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend Bill Clinton.\\nGood night, Chicago.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nJohn Mulaney, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don’t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That’s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn’t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a– There’s no value to your doing that at all.\\n“The Old Lady And The Dog”\\nI live– I live in New York. I always– Like, there’s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she’s always walking her dog. She’s always just– she’s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just– The two of them, it’s really– The dog’s got a cloudy eye, and she’s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and– And she’s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5’10”, But now it’s just, like, this sweater And her legs are– her legs are a nightmare. They’re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, “yecch, no thank you. “I do not want those. “I’d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.” I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, “god, I hope she dies first.” I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don’t want her to lose the dog. I don’t think she’ll be able to handle it. If she dies– If the old lady dies first, I’m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn’t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He’s living in two-second increments. The second he’s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she’s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he’s all she has because she has him. There’s no– If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, “good morning, gladys,” She’d be like, “good,” And just flush him down the toilet, just– Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! “” she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!\\n“My Daughter Likes Fish”\\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter’s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn’t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that’s a weird moment, too, ’cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, “yeah, he’s dead,” And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, “wait a second! Aw, shit! “I was taking a nap! Jesus! “you gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.” And then my daughter comes home. “why did he die, da–” Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That’s \",\n",
       "  'the reason. That’s the actual reason, is because didn’t matter That he was alive. That’s why he’s dead. He didn’t know his name, and he didn’t love you back. These are the facts about that fish’s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don’t know which one. I don’t care. I don’t think they need to be separate things. I really don’t. They don’t care, and we don’t care. There’s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, “ok, everybody. “from now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And–you know what?–Penguins are all seals now,” And we would all be like, “yeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.” Anyway, so we’re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And he’s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he’s going– They’re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you’re gonna see little, white sheep Going, “baa,” but they’re all fat and shit-colored, And they’re like– Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don’t go– They go– My daughter’s like, “what is he saying?” I don’t know! “I’m a slave! Kill me!”\\n“The Food Chain”\\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I’m glad I’m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you’re in the food chain. You’re in the food– we are out of the food chain. I don’t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That’s how all life ends, is– Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We’re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just “I love you. Bye.” I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You’re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You’re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it’s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, “beh,” and you’re like, “fine,” And it’s just, “why?” You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone’s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don’t get it! Then you’re walking to work like, “why do I even bother? “shit! Goddamn it! “there’s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!” You think that sharks– Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they’d be bummed ’cause I don’t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they’re slick. They swim around like, “hey, nobody has any idea what’s down here,” And we’re all up here like, “there’s totally a shark right there.” It wouldn’t be fun being a predator, either. If you’re a predator, imagine if every time you’re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who’s running for his life. You gotta– “come on, dude! Shit, get over here!” And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That’s why animals just– They go, “let’s do this together, man. “you chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.” That’s why they do it like that. “fuck it. I’m eating babies. This is bullshit.” “grownups ain’t worth the meat.” Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn’t a gay voice, by the way. It’s not. Shut up. yeah.\\n“Courtyard Confrontation”\\nI live in New York city, and it’s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn’t. Didn’t matter. I was a child. But I’m not used to it ’cause it’s nice. There’s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don’t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can’t get a fountain made without– “can you make me a foun',\n",
       "  'tain?” “yes, I’ll get started right away! “Yes! Yes! It’s finished!” And it’s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. “just piss on me forever!” Anyway, there’s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn’t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That’s my least presentable hour. There’s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever… And so I’m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I’m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there’s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there’s this guy looking at me. I notice he’s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he’s all spiffy-looking. He’s got brown shoes, and he’s looking at me like, “” I can tell he was thinking I don’t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he’s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I’m sitting there thinking, Like, “please do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,” And I’m trying to look even more gross, And I’m, like, pulling up my shirt, “” And then I see him go, “no. That’s not gonna do at all,” And he comes over to me, “” and I’m like, “Num num num!” I’m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I’m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. “rrgh!” So he comes over, says, “excuse me, “do you live in this building?” And I said, “no,” ’cause why not start there? I said, “no.” He goes, “well then, what are you doing here?” And I said, “I just need to rest. I’m having a hard time.” He says, “this is private property,” And I said, “well, I don’t really believe in that.” You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, “well, if you don’t leave, I’m gonna talk to the doorman.” I was like, “can I just stay, like, five more hours?” So he’s–“no,” and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, “no. That guy lives here. It’s OK,” And the look on his face– mwah mwah! Num num!– It was just so– It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It’s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody’s feelings. That’s how excited I was.\\n“Getting What ‘Old’ Is”\\nI’m 45 now, So I’m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don’t know which one. I won’t know till it’s over where this was. I don’t know how long I’m gonna live. I don’t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, “that’s too bad.” If I die five years from now, they’ll be like, “well, all right,” like it’s not even– It’s– Like, as soon as you’re 50, you’re a candidate. You know, there’s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing– You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they’re in the news, and it’s always some old guy, “I met Napoleon.” No, you didn’t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you’re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn’t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I’m like, “wow, this seems early for this.” Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I’ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I’ll realize, “I need to wipe my ass right now.” “I mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.” Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I’m 45. Already, my asshole’s just like, “Just– ” My asshole– My asshole’s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda… Loose and ineffectual. My asshole’s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It’s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wi',\n",
       "  'nd. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. “rats.” That’s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here’s another thing about my age right now. If I’m– OK. Say I’m sitting down. If I’m sitting anywhere, which–ha ha ha!– I love sitting so much– I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what– At my age, if I’m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. “what? Why do I– no. Why, though?” “Your car is being towed right now!” “Well, that’s what happens to me, then. That’s– I accept that.” ’cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, “do I really want to be alive anymore?” Like, let’s start with that, And then I gotta, “” start kind of rocking to get momentum, “” like I’m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. “shit.”\\n“Putting On Socks”\\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because– Putting on my socks, that means I have to– Here’s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don’t even know how I do it. I’m sitting here. I don’t know how I do that. It’s ’cause you have to– It’s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel– I’m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. “beep, beep, beep!” And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people’s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson’s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it’s agony, And I saw this and I thought, “OK. That’s hard.” That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn’t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I’ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.\\n“If You’re Older You’re Smarter”\\nI don’t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you’re older, you’re smarter. I just believe that. If you’re in an argument with somebody And they’re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn’t mean they’re right. It means that even if they’re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They’ve been there longer. If you’re older, you’re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That’s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here’s the interesting thing. There’s way more. I can see you. There’s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn’t clap. Why? ’cause they’re smart. They’re sitting in the dark going, “I don’t have to clap. I don’t have to do anything.” They’re not doing it, and they’re right. You know why? ’cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don’t know why I’m asking. How do you know what– OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I’m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That’s every time. “Whoo! Whoo!” every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you’re not the only people here. That’s like going to a cancer ward– “not me! Whoo! I don’t have it! I don’t have it!” If you’re older, you’re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, ’cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He’s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He’s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair… From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a mi',\n",
       "  'nor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That’s what I’m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He’s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He’s seen more. He’s seen history. He’s witnessed history, Even if it’s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy ’cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, “the president’s kind of disappointing.” Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away… And the whole nation just watched him go.\\n“Getting Older Makes My Life Better”\\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, ’cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they’re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don’t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam’s apple and a smelly t-shirt. “hey, I’m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.” “so where do I– everywhere? OK. Cool.” But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I’d like to make one of those “it gets better” ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, “listen, man. “I know it’s tough right now. “You’re vaguely heavy with no face. “You have zero value on the sexual marketplace. “You feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, “but it gets better because you’ll all grow up, “and you pretty much look just like this your whole life, “and they don’t. “Their options start running out really fast, “and you’re gonna be there. “As long as you stay relatively employed and washed, “you’re gonna be amazing in your 40s. “You’re gonna be– “you’re gonna be the branch that she can grab “before she hits the ground. “It’s gonna be so great. “It just takes time for her circumstances “to match your looks, but it’s gonna happen. “It’s gonna happen. “When real shit matters, you’re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.” It’s just time. That’s all it takes. There’s a formula to this. It’s pussy plus time over income squared.\\n“Everybody Has Their Time”\\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there’s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, “there’s someone for everyone.” Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it ’cause it’s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we’ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That’s all that happens, “aww,” and if you’re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. “Aww.” Well, go fuck one. “Nah.” I didn’t think so. That’s the one way we’re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, “yeah. No. You should. I’m totally up. Yeah.”\\n“Dating Takes Courage”\\nIt’s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is– It’s how we evolve, is dating. It’s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it’s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I’m always happy when I see a couple on a date ’cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there’s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she’s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in',\n",
       "  ' your body is telling you, “just go the fuck home and jerk off. Don’t do this!” But he walked up and said, “hi. Yes,” And she’s like, “” “no, no, no. A second. Give me a second,” And you try to get through this membrane of, you know– And then, if it works And you say, “you wanna go out sometime?” Sometimes she’ll say yes, and if she says yes, that’s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species’ existence counts on them doing it, and I don’t know how they– How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We’re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we’re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We’re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That’s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That’s the whole thing. That’s it, just our own heart going, “dude, I can’t– “you can’t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,” But women still– “yeah. I’ll go out with you alone at night.” What are you, nuts? “I’ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?” “To your death, statistically.” How do they still do it? If you’re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you’re like, “I hope this one’s nice. I hope he doesn’t do what he’s going to do.”\\n“First Date”\\nI always– I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it’s the first date ’cause of the way they’re walking together And she’s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he’s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He’s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive– Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, “well… “ha ha! “well, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh…” Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that’s later down the line and something has happened. There’s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness ’cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, “I’m gonna let him fuck me.” They just get to decide. Something he says, and she’s like, “that was good. He’s gonna fuck me later,” And he has no idea. He’s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he’s already in there.\\n“Tits”\\nGuys are– We love women a lot– all men do– And we just look at you. That’s what I do. I just look at women. I just–“” Like they’re, you know, cakes in windows. I just–“” I was walking in New York once, and there’s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, ’cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that’s gonna help me in any way, to hear their– “don’t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?” OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It’s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you’re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, “could you squeeze my tit for one second?” And 100% of us will go, “yes, of course.” That doesn’t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. “yeah. Ok.” Beep! “don’t worry. He’s not your tits. Don’t worry about it.” I don’t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it’s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don’t usually– You don’t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look– You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman’s tit. “thank you, Deborah. I’ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.” It’s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of “the grapes of wrath,” Which I don’t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don’t know if you read “the grapes of wrath,” But that’s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl',\n",
       "  '’s tits, And then the book is over, and you’re like, “Jesus! What happened at the end there? That’s crazy.” There’s no other book in that genre. There’s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very– “and then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.” “holy moly with that!” “the end.” “my god! “that is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I’ve been reading this book for three months.” But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place– Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium– And you’re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you’re like, “that’s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!” Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, ’cause you could drive a tack in there, I’m not gonna feel it, But a tit– Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow… “it’s a tit! I touched a tit! “I touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.” That’s rare, to touch one tit. It’s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn’t have permission, But otherwise… When tit access is granted, It’s usually good for two tits at a time. It’s, once you’re on one– You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn’t get the second one. “yeah, it’s like your mom’s dirty whore tit.” “why? What? I said I liked it. “that’s what I meant, is that I like it. “I like your mom’s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,” And if it’s up to the guy, we’re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, “you know what? “I’m good with the one. That’s fine for me. Everything in moderation.” We’re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of– “yeah–” “there’s a bomb!” “shit! Come on, let’s get– “come on! Let’s get your tits out of here!”\\n“Divorce”\\nI’ve seen a few tits. I’ve seen–I don’t know– 48 maybe. I don’t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I’ve been divorced for five years, And it’s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I’m not saying don’t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that’s the best part. It’s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything’s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, ” my divorce is falling apart. It’s over. I can’t take it.” And again, if you’re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you’re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I’m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That’s just a fact. I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but it’s true. Everything’s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We’re good co-parents because we live apart and we’re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I’m a good father. I’m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? ‘Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It’s like every parent’s fantasy. Who can’t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, “good-bye, girls. “Daddy’s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.” “I’m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.” That’s why I’m such a good dad.\\n“Videoing Your Kids”\\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody’s there, and everybody’s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch ’cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this',\n",
       "  '. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids– I went over by the stage and the kids– There’s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we’re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can’t see their parents, And everybody’s watching a shitty movie Of something that’s happening ten feet– Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It’s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You’re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you’re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don’t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. “here, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.” And then you get to read all the comments. “my god! “it’s so cute! Ngaah!” And guess what? They’re not watching it, either. They’re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, “that’s very nice. OK. Back to this.” Nobody’s watching your kids’ videos on Facebook, I promise you. I’ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid’s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. “That’s adorable! I think I see a future star!”\\n“Life Is A Good Deal”\\nDon’t tape shit on your– Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it ’cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that’s an ama– Here’s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all–my god– what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It’s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head ’cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you’re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn’t matter who’s president or anything, You just–“” Every time I’m eating bacon, I think, “I could die right now,” and I mean it! That’s how good life is. You get to– you get to fuck. That’s free if you’re smart. That comes with. That’s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you’re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you’re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend’s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it’s nice and warm and tight in there, And he’s your buddy. If you’re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they’re doing, and… It’s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read “to kill a mockingbird.” It’s a great life. So, you know, I’m not worried about it ending.\\n“Behind The Wheel”\\nIt’s pretty good, and I’ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don’t know. You know, it’s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they’re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I’m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I’m behind the wheel, which is when I’m at my most dangerous. When you’re driving, That’s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life ’cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it’s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of–I don’t know– sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, “worthless piece of shit.” I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to',\n",
       "  ' feel about another human being? “Worthless piece of shit”? That’s somebody’s son. And things I’ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did– I don’t remember, even– And I yelled out my window, I said, “hey, fuck you!” Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person’s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, “hey, fuck you!”? “worthless piece of shit!” No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there’s nothing you would not say to them. “I hope you die!” I said that to a person. “I hope you die!” Why? ’cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!” I mean, what am I capable of? I’d like to think that I’m a nice person, But I don’t know, man.\\n“If Murder Was Legal”\\nA lot of it is context. There’s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don’t know. I’d love to think, “I would never do that,” But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We’d like to think it’s ’cause, Like, “I would never do that.” No. It’s ’cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor– Like you get a thing in the mail– “shit, they had a camera there. Well.” If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn’t trust somebody who didn’t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn’t like them. “I never killed anybody.” “OK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. “I mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. “what’s wrong with that guy? He’s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.” “I think he’s nice.” “shut up, Janet.” They would just– If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That’s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you’d go to a mall, there’d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just– “I told you to stop it! You didn’t listen to me!” Just–pbbt! There’d be just– You’d be stepping over dead kids. There’d be, like, a new problem. “you have to clean up your kids “when you kill them ’cause it’s gross. “it’s bad for the environment. “if you murder your child in a public place, “please use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers “every three feet of America. “put your murdered child in the red bag “with a logo of a murdered kid on it “next to the other logo that tells you “not to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag “because they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.” That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.\\n“Of Course, But Maybe”\\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing– That’s the thing I believe– and then there’s this thing, and I don’t believe it, but it is there. It’s always this thing and then this thing. It’s become a category in my brain That I call, “of course… But maybe…” I’ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe… Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you’re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I’d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe… maybe if we all just do this for one year, w',\n",
       "  'e’re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you’re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it’s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course… But maybe… Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it’s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It’s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you’re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don’t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it’s happened– Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it’s a terrible, horrible thing, of course… But maybe… Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, “how did they build those pyramids?” They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew ’em up and didn’t give a shit what happened to them. There’s no end to what you can do when you don’t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That’s where human greatness comes from, is that we’re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they’re making these, They jump off the fucking roof ’cause it’s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you’re taking a shit.\\nThanks a lot, folks.

Opening with the soothing tones of “Dream A Little Dream Of Me,” he dives headfirst into a rowdy night in Charlotte, immediately roasting a guy’s questionable footwear and never looking back. It’s a masterclass in improv, where every audience member becomes a character in Matt’s unpredictable story—a guy rocking Santa’s elf boots, a woman managing her mom’s eyebrow-raising business, and even a stay-at-home dad who proudly owns his role. Rife seamlessly weaves these hilarious, sometimes bizarre interactions into a theme that’s surprisingly heartfelt: dreams. Not just the kind that keep you up at night—though there’s plenty of talk about witches and teeth falling out—but the ones you chase with everything you’ve got. In between the jokes, Matt reflects on how living his dream brought him to this exact moment, encouraging everyone in the room to keep pursuing theirs, no matter how absurd or impossible they might seem. The special is a chaotic blend of laughter, awkward confessions, and genuine moments of connection, all wrapped up in Matt’s signature mix of charm and razor-sharp wit. And just like that, Charlotte gets the honor of being the birthplace of Netflix’s first-ever crowd work special—proof that when dreams and comedy collide, anything can happen.\\n* * *\\n[“Dream A Little Dream Of Me” by The Mamas & The Papas playing]\\n♪ Stars shining bright above you ♪\\n♪ Night breezes seem to whisper, “I love you” ♪\\n♪ Birds singin’ in the sycamore tree ♪\\n♪ Dream a little dream of me ♪\\n ♪ Sweet dreams ’til sunbeams find you ♪\\n♪ Sweet dreams That leave all worries behind you ♪\\n♪ But in your dreams, whatever they be ♪\\n♪ Dream a little dream of me ♪\\n[music fades]\\n[announcer] Matt Rife!\\n[crowd cheering]\\n[Matt] What’s up, Charlotte? Good to see everybody. What the fuck are you wearing, dawg?\\n[crowd laughing]\\n[Matt] What?! I thought you were Cam Newton for a second. [crowd laughing] [Matt] Charlotte, you never know. What’s up? Fig Newton, man. My boy. Good to see you, man. Goddamn Shaboozey in the building, man. The boots, though. Can I see one? People in back can’t see. Can I show them? Oh, you gotta see this shit, bro! [woman] Oh my God! [crowd cheering] [applause] This shit right here! Oh my God! You look like if you click your heels together three times, you go back to Atlanta.\\nThis is fucking wild!\\n[crowd laughing] Black dudes’ dicks are so big, even their shoes curve. That’s crazy to me, dude. Congratulations, man. Where do you get something like that?\\nIt’s a gift.\\n[Matt] That’s a gift? Fire that friend, immediately. That is fucking crazy. Dressed like Santa’s favorite elf, man. [chuckles]\\nThis your boy?\\n[man] Yeah.\\nBoth from Atlanta?\\nNah, I’m from South Carolina.\\nOh, I love South Carolina. What part?\\nUh, Winnsboro. Winnsboro? Uh oh. White people are groaning. [crowd laughing] Which probably means it’s a great time, if I’m being honest. We in the woods. We 30 minutes from Columbia. You’re speaking to me in full South Carolina right now. You are making this white man very uncomfortable right now. Chill out there, dude. He got a watch on and everything. He’s like, “Should’ve worn sleeves, fuck.” [crowd laughing] This is a good friendship. You stick together. But be a better friend, tell him not to wear that bullshit anywhere else. You understand? And I don’t fucking to…\\nThis motherfucker’s skiing inside.\\n[crowd laughing] Your shoes got tusks.\\nThat’s crazy to me.\\n[man] He said… You kn… You knew it was gonna get called on.\\nThat’s an even better, but shitty friend.\\n[man] He warned me. His boy pulled up to the house in the boots… [crowd laughing] …and he was like, “Oh!” “You ’bout to kill ’em!” You set his ass up so much, man. And that’s a good friend. Damn it, that’s a good friend, man. Good to see y’all. Thanks for being here. I wanted to come back, sh',\n",
       "  'oot this special in Charlotte, ’cause I’ve been performing in this club since I was 16 years old.\\nSo this is a very special place for me.\\n[crowd cheering] It… Well… [applause] Well, you know, you guys weren’t there. So, totally okay. It’s all right. I know everybody was very busy until two years ago. It’s totally okay. I have so many fond memories here. People in Charlotte, you somehow always and never disappoint at the same time. So, I wanted to come get to know you guys a little bit. I’m curious, who has been to one of my shows before? Anybody? [crowd cheering] Yep. That’s everybody who was here before. Okay. I’m like, “That checks out.” No, I can work with that. Was it here in Charlotte you saw me?\\n[woman] Yeah.\\nIt was?\\nWay back then?\\n[woman] Bojangles.\\nBojangles?\\n[woman] Yeah. Was I performing in a Bojangles? [crowd laughing] Jesus Christ. Someone’s like, “Don’t choke.” You’re like, “Have you had the biscuits? It’s hard not to.” That’s awesome. Thanks for coming back. That’s so cool. This show is going to be completely different from anything you’ve seen live or on Netflix before, um… If you’ve seen one of my shows, I perform an hour, hour and 15 minutes, usually, for that long of a show. Out of that hour-15, I do maybe ten minutes of crowd work. It’s a small part, what you see online, compared to what we tour the country with. This show is gonna be different, it’s an entire crowd work special. This is just me and you. I don’t know what you’re gonna say. I don’t know what I’m gonna say. I want you to be aware, you are equally at fault for how this goes as am I, okay? I’m excited to get to know you guys a little bit. As much as this is gonna be a crowd work special, I do wanna stick with one theme, and that theme for the night is gonna be “dreams.” I’ve chosen this theme because it’s very special to me, considering it’s not lost on me at all that I’m one of very few people who gets to live their dream. I’m so fucking blessed for that. But I know I’m not alone in that process. That’s the one thing all of us do have in common, right? Every person in this room has a dream or some kind of aspiration, and it doesn’t matter where you fall. Whether you’ve achieved your dreams or you still live in Charlotte, it doesn’t really matter. It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter where you fall, as long as you’re chasing something. Life is about the pursuit, and I’m so happy this is the pursuit that, uh, went well for me, man. I started stand-up when I was 15, so it’s easy to assume this is all I wanted to do. That’s not true, I had other aspirations. Before I wanted to be a comedian, all of middle school, I thought I was going to join the military. That was my big thing. We would’ve lost every war ever. You guys are very welcome that this worked out instead. But it’s all I ever grew up with. A lot of times, you’re a product of your surroundings. I come from four generations of Navy, so I thought I’d do the same thing.\\n[scattered clapping]\\nYeah, well, Old Navy, so not really… [crowd laughing] [Matt] Got a couple locations, I appreciate it, though. Thank you. They are all military, my family. That’s all I saw growing up, you know? I saw the original Top Gun movie when I was like 11 years old. I found out what a fighter pilot was, and I was like, “Fuck yeah. I wanna be gay.”\\nYou know? I didn’t even know…\\n[crowd laughing] Didn’t even know that was an option, you know what I mean? I wanted it bad too. All of middle school, I was going to air shows. I was reading every book about every airplane ever made. I was autistic for like four and a half years. I feel like I’m a better-rounded person because of that chapter in my life. Just fucking wanted it. I was really passionate about something. That dream came to a halt in fucking ninth grade. Second week of freshman year, I had to get glasses.\\n[crowd] Aww.\\nFound out my vision was just fucked. As you can imagine, to be a fighter pilot, you have to have beyond perfect vision. So that was never gonna happen. I’d be a terrible pilot. I would’ve missed both those towers. I don’t have it in me. I… [laughing] I lack depth perception, and that’s why we’re here tonight, living this dream instead. So I just wanna say be patient. You don’t know what’s down the pipeline. You don’t always know what’s meant for you. So as much as you’ll learn more about me tonight, I wanna get to know you ’cause I know I can’t be the only person in this room who really strives for something that might seem impossible. So I’m curious, to start tonight’s show, if there’s anybody here in this audience who’s chasing a dream that, on paper, probably seems impossible or ridiculous, and people try to discourage you from pursuing it, but you’re like, “Fuck that, it’s what I wanna do more than anything.” “It’s what I know I’m meant to be here to do.” “I’m gonna give it 1010%.” I’m curious, of this show tonight, if anybody has a dream that they’re cha',\n",
       "  'sing at this very moment. [woman] Woo!\\nNope? Okay, fantastic.\\n[crowd laughing] No, that’s actually great. No, that’s good.\\nYou have a current dream you’re chasing?\\n[woman] Yeah, I am. What’s your dream? Right now, I’m managing my mom’s “You Blow Me” company. She teaches… Hold on. [crowd laughing] Hold on. Hold on, I’ve… I’ve seen this website before. Hold on. You manage this? [indistinct yelling] She teaches women how to give blowjobs.\\n[Matt] Is that a real thing?\\nYes! [chuckling] Get the fuck out of here! I swear. She’s right over there. Ask her.\\nYour mom’s over here?\\n[woman] Yes. Well, hello. [crowd laughing] [Matt] Well, uh… Before we dive into anything, where’s Dad? At home! At home!\\nHe’s not here?\\n[woman] Not here!\\n\\n\\n\\nIt can’t be that good.\\n[crowd yelling] Can’t be that good. I’m just saying. Eh… [crowd cheering] I mean… [woman 2] He’s not here ’cause I wore his ass out. [crowd laughing] This motherfucker is at home like one of those anti-weed commercials.\\n[groans]\\n[crowd laughing] [chuckling] Just sunken and deflated into the couch. Okay. There’s so many different directions to go with this. Um… How did… [giggles] [scattered laughter] How did you… When did you know you were, like, GOATED? Does that make any sense? When did you know you had the technique down? When did you know? Probably when I was 17. [crowd laughing] Talk to me about this business you run. Is this a website? Is it a class? Is it… It is an online video.\\nA tutorial?\\n[woman 2] A tutorial.\\nOkay.\\nIt’s a 17-minute video.\\nOoh.\\n[crowd laughing] Then it can’t be that good, you know? There’s just no way. There’s no way. This shit… This should be a two-and-a-half-minute video, tops. [crowd laughing] [crowd whistling and cheering] [chuckling] Man!\\nOkay.\\nI turn people into three-minute miracles. “Three-minute miracles.” Okay. Happily married for 26 years. Happily married for 26 years. I believe that. I don’t have to cook. I don’t have to clean. You don’t cook, you don’t clean? Okay, Cardi B, chill the fuck out. [crowd laughing] I had to watch her suck it. You what?\\n[crowd clamoring]\\nYou’ve seen your mom on the dildo? I’m the manager. You are acting like South Carolina right now, and I’m trying to wrap my head around this.\\n[crowd cheering]\\nUm… It’s, uh… [chuckling] Okay. Okay, I totally forgot what you said your dream even was after this. What was it again? I wanna sell houses, but this is just a good starting point. Well, listen, I guarantee you can close on any house. [crowd laughing] If you really are dedicated as the, uh… as the realtor.\\nYou wanna do real estate.\\n[woman] Yeah.\\nWonderful. How old are you?\\nTwenty-two. Twenty-two. Okay. You in college?\\n[woman] I just graduated.\\nWhere from? Coastal Carolina. Oh… [crowd laughing] Okay. No, that’s… It’s a school.\\nThat’s… Yeah.\\n[crowd laughing]\\nWhat did you study there?\\nMarketing. How do you market a dick-sucking class?\\n[crowd laughing]\\n“Check it out, it’s nuts!” Like what… Like how… What’s the marketing strategy? Experience. She taught me. [giggles] I’ve never been this hard this early in a show in my entire life. Like, thank God I’m sitting down. I’d be… I’d be tucked in my fucking belt right now, dude.\\nSo, Mom?\\n[woman 2] Yes. What were you doing before this was a job? I… You’re gonna… Come? Yeah, I might. [crowd laughing] I might.\\nWe owned an ice cream truck company.\\nYou owned an ice… [crowd laughing] I’ve seen that video before. I’ve seen that video. You really went a different direction. Before that, I sold sex toys. I did home parties for sex toys. Okay. So the ice cream truck was out-of-pocket for you. That’s why. That… That’s where you strayed, actually. Did you used to sell, um… Did you ever sell Sybian machines?\\nNo.\\nYou guys know what they are? [crowd] No.\\nYou don’t know what it is?\\n[woman 3] No! I’m about to fuck y’all up, dude. Are you serious? I’m actually so honored I get to be the one to tell you what this is. Okay. All right.\\nTake a seat. Hold on.\\n[crowd laughing] Okay. So it’s… It’s a sex toy, right? And at the base of it is a… is a motor, right? And I’m not exaggerating, picture a V12 engine. Like, it is a fucking brick of machinery, dude. It is like this, as a… as a… as a motor, right? So, then there’s the battery, and off the end of the battery is like a metal arm, right? Like a foot, foot-and-a-half long, and at the end of the arm is a… Dildo, it’s called? Yeah, right? Got it. We’re all following so far, right? So then a woman, usually… [crowd laughing] Doesn’t discriminate. …will sit at the base of the arm like such… [crowd laughing] …and then a dude in a lab coat throws a lever, Frankenstein-style, and this machine just goes… [imitates machine] [grunts] [crowd laughing]\\n[crowd cheering]\\nAnd then women wonder why we can’t make them come. [crowd laughing] Who made that? I mean, who was just getting fucking piped down, and was like, “Not enough horsepower.” [crowd laughing] I couldn’t believe the sex toys that ',\n",
       "  'fucking exist. You guys are very welcome, add that your Amazon wish list. Oh my goodness. If you had to give one piece of blow job advice, what would you be like… What’s the thing that’s missing, that every girl should be doing? This. When you give a blowjob, use lubricant. [indistinct chatter] Hold on, what kind of lubricant? He’s shaking his head, “Yes.” He’s gay, okay? It’s true. [crowd laughing and yelling] Gay? I knew it. I knew it. Yep. I knew a good-looking guy when I fucking saw one, man. He uses his parents’ tears. [crowd laughing]\\n[crowd] Ooh!\\nKidding! Kidding! Kidding. Shut up. [crowd yelling] God. So kidding, so kidding. You look fucking fantastic. Fascinating. I am fucking… I don’t even know what we’re talking about anymore. [crowd] Dreams. Dreams, yeah. I’m living one right now. This is… This is fantastic. In the back. She raised her hand. Go to school. [crowd laughing] What is your dream? Uh, after COVID, had to realign, I am going to school to be a special ed teacher.\\nNo way! That’s incredible.\\n[applause] Okay. Okay… So specifically special needs teacher?\\n[woman] Yeah.\\nOkay. Uh, why, specifically, special needs? Well… Easier? [crowd laughing] I mean… Earlier lunch? You know, whatever. There’s… There’s definitely perks. What about that specifically? You could teach any subject. I needed healthcare, and so I went to… Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. You’re doing it for the perks? I like you already. [crowd laughing] That’s strong-minded right there. [chuckling] Okay, you needed healthcare. Now, what age group of special needs students are you going to teach? Uh, K through five.\\nK through five. So the very beginning?\\nYes. How do you even really know somebody’s special needs before fifth grade? Especially kindergarten, you know? Like, you never really know. I know you can’t say names, but do you have a favorite student now? Yeah, my daughter. [daughter] Oh my God. [crowd yelling and laughing] [applause] [Matt laughs] What a subtle burn, dude. Is your daughter special needs? She’s thinking about it. [crowd laughing] [Matt] Wow. They usually don’t do that. [chuckling] So that’s fantastic. Totally… Daughter, how old are you? I’m 24. [Matt] Okay. Okay, that’s good. She knows her age. Okay. What do you do right now? I’m a behavioral therapist.\\n[Matt] That’s…\\n[crowd laughing] Okay, so the ones she can’t teach, she puts off to you. I love this. I love this. Now, was this your dream career?\\n\\n\\n\\nNo.\\n[Matt] No? Fair enough. Fair enough. That’s amazing. You support your mom’s dream of helping teach special needs students? Of course. I used to work in her school. [Matt] Really? Doing? Uh, personal needs assistant. You know what? As fun as this is to joke around about, you’re doing incredibly noble things, very selfless, helping a lot of people.\\nThank you very much for doing that.\\n[applause] [Matt] That is awesome. That is so cool, man. Okay, so now we met somebody who’s at the beginning of chasing their dreams. Does anybody feel like they’re actively in the process of living that dream?\\n[man] Boom.\\nUh oh. Okay. All right. Off the top, you’re already the white version of him. I wanna be very aware of the crowd. Okay. Okay, what’s your dream? I’m a stay-at-home dad. Stay-at-home dad. [crowd cheering] Nice, dude. Yeah, you got dick on you for sure, man. [crowd laughing] [Matt] She letting that slide? For sure. How many kids do you have? A little boy and a… a girl. It took you a minute. [crowd laughing] He didn’t choose their pronouns yet. Let’s be patient. Let’s be patient. How old are they? Uh, nine months, this Thursday, and an 11-year-old.\\nYou have a nine-month-old?\\n[man] Yeah. You shouldn’t be here right now, dude. [chuckles]\\nIs that the wife and mom?\\nYes. Okay, I wanted to make sure. I never wanna… [crowd laughing] Charlotte, you never know. Now, you have to be in a good position to allow him to be a stay-at-home dad. What do you do? Interventional radiology.\\n[crowd yelling]\\nWhat? Wait, hold on. Hold on. Those are two very different words. So radiology, like X-rays and stuff, right?\\nFancy X-rays.\\n[Matt] Fancy X-rays, got it.\\n“Intervention”?\\n[woman] Yeah. Does that mean a group of people, you get them to go into a room like, “Fucking get in there”? [crowd laughing] How do you do an intervention radiology? She assists people that save lives. She can speak for herself, okay?\\nShe spoke before, right?\\nRight! [crowd cheering] You the woman of the house, okay? When we out here, she runs shit, all right? Okay. Ma’am. [crowd laughing]\\nBreak it down for me. What is it?\\nIt’s minimally invasive surgery. Minimally invasive surgery. Having a cyst removed, that kind of thing? No, like going in through tiny holes with catheters up to people’s brains. Hold on. You can run a catheter to your brain? [crowd laughing] It can go from your dick hole? Isn’t that a catheter?\\n[woman] That’s a Foley catheter.\\nA what?\\nThat’s a Foley catheter.\\n[Ma',\n",
       "  'tt] A Foley catheter. Where does the other one go? [woman] In through your arteries. Oh, so in, like, a vein. Up to the brain. Got it. Okay. I was about to say. Goddamn! [exhales] They gonna need a bigger needle, am I right? Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Okay. Okay, so just a little invasive. Working in the medical field pays well? That makes… That makes a lot of sense. I love that you do that, helping other people. Nurses are some of my favorite people. Love them. What were you doing before you were a stay-at-home dad? Pulling out? [crowd laughing]\\nWhat were you actually doing?\\nTruck driver. Truck driver? Oof. Okay.\\nCross-country or local?\\nLocal. So was it your idea for him to be stay-at-home dad, or was he like, “We should cut back on a babysitter, let me chill”? It just made more sense that way. I love that you’re okay. Very progressive, by the way. Men always feel overly-masculine…\\nI’m a child.\\nYou’re a child? You do look like you outgrew that shirt, like, after showing it. [chuckles] We got this last year too. This is not an old shirt.\\nThat’s a new shirt?\\n[man] Yeah. Button it. [crowd laughing] [Matt] Oh, no, dude. [chuckling] Oh shit! [laughing] His knuckles are turning white, dude. This is so bad. Congratulations on your third, by the way. [crowd laughing] There it is! [crowd cheering] Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Ah! [chuckling] I love it. Yeah, make yourself comfortable, man. Let them titties breathe, man. You’re doing the right thing, man. I wish you the best. What a happy, functional family. Did not expect to find this in North Carolina. Congratulations. Anybody feel like they’re in the middle of living their dream? They are currently, now? You had your hand up first. [woman] Yeah. What are you doing? What’s your dream that came true? [woman] I’m a pilot.\\n[crowd cheering]\\n[Matt] Ooh. Okay. What airline? I’m not saying. [crowd laughing] That’s the “Spirit.” I’m sure.\\n[crowd laughing]\\n[Matt] Yeah. Mm. If it was United or Delta, she would’ve said that, you know? Mm. Suspicious. Is it commercial or private?\\nIt’s airline.\\n[Matt] Airline? Okay. All right. This was always your dream growing up? Always?\\n[woman] Yeah.\\nHow long does it take to become a pilot? Depends on your motivation and what route you go. There’s so many ways you can go. What was your motivation? Let me ask you that first. Um, I wanted to get to the airlines as fast as I possibly could, so I got… Have you tried TSA PreCheck? [crowd laughing] What’s the quickest route to the airlines? [woman 3] Blowjob. [crowd laughing] [crowd cheering and clapping] I didn’t say that. I didn’t say it. I believe you earned your spot.\\nI do believe that.\\n[woman] Thank you. So what was… What was… What was the actual…? What was the quickest route to the airlines for you? There are some programs that can get you the main ratings you need in nine months. Then you have to get 1,500 flight hours. What airplane can you practice on?\\nCan you do crop planes? Does that count?\\nYep.\\nThat can count?\\nYep. That should not count. [crowd laughing] That’s like getting your driver’s license, “I’ve been riding my bike for years.” [crowd laughing] “I imagine it’s the same thing.” You can actually solo an airplane at 16 years old. By yourself.\\n[Matt] No fucking way.\\nYeah.\\nYou can get a pilot’s license at 16?\\nNo, you can just fly it solo.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Matt] Really?\\nYeah. You’d think more people would’ve got off that island. [crowd laughing] Fucking awesome, as somebody who had their pilot dreams immediately squashed.\\nFucking awesome. I’m jealous.\\nYou can still do it.\\nI can still do it?\\nYep.\\nYou don’t have to have perfect eyesight?\\nIf you wanna be a fighter pilot, sure. No, you don’t have to, as long as it’s correctable. Oh, so I’d have to get Lasik or something. Or glasses, contacts. I’m not gonna trust a pilot with glasses. I’m just not going to, I’m sorry. Then you don’t wanna look up into the flight deck. If it’s not Spirit Airlines, I don’t think I have to worry about it. Let me ask you this, though. Were you… Was there ever a plan B? If you weren’t a pilot, were you planning anything else? I worked in marketing for six months, and I said, “Absolutely not. No more.”\\n[crowd laughing]\\nYou worked in marketing? Mm. You’ve ruined that job… [crowd laughing] …for everybody else in this show. Damn. Congratulations. I love this. We’ve got someone actively living a dream, and somebody who’s actively pursuing a dream, at the very beginning of it. Does anybody feel like they missed an opportunity to achieve a dream? They now do something else. You might have a flourishing career, but ultimately it’s not what you wanted, you feel like you had an opportunity back in the day and it just didn’t happen.\\nMissed opportunity.\\n[woman] Yes. Back row, right here, my man. It’s unfortunate, but if I was a girl, I wanted to be a pole dancer. Really bad. I’m sorry I called you gay. [crowd laughing] [Matt] I’m so sorry. That’s gay, dude. [crowd laughing] D',\n",
       "  'id you say, if you were a girl, you would have liked to have been a pole dancer?\\nYes, absolutely.\\nYou still c… You still can. You’ve never seen Magic Mike or something? Yes, sure. Clearly, I’m not Magic Mike. [Matt] Oh, no, I disagree, man. I still think you could jump headfirst into this job. What are you doing now? Right now I work in finance. It’s boring as fuck. That’s not fun at all. Doesn’t pole dancing seem a little bit more fun? Have you been to a male strip club before? I prefer female strip clubs.\\n‘Cause you respect the athleticism?\\nYes. Fair enough. No, no, that fucking… That works. And they have good brunches. [crowd laughing and cheering] That is the last place you wanna find a hair in your food, dude. Do not eat at a strip club, dude. Come on! Listen, I’m on the same page as you. I respect the hell out of strippers. I do. Strippers, I get. A strip club doesn’t do it for me. I’m a shitty person to go to a strip… I don’t spend any money at all. I’m just not impressed with the environment, you know what I mean? To spend a dollar in a strip club, I would need to see these girls on a full American Ninja Warrior course. That’s what it would take. I’ll make it rain when you get to the top of that salmon ladder, how about that? [laughs] You got these girls butt-naked, with just heels on, like… [crowd laughing] “It wasn’t called the salmon ladder till she got on it.”\\n[crowd] Ooh!\\nAnd then for… And then… And then for the big finale, they gotta run up that warped wall to win the… GED, or… I don’t know. I don’t know what they’d need for it. That would spice things up to me. Maybe we can bring in an extra element to the strip club. That could be so fun. Have you ever, like, brainstormed a stripper name? Yeah. [crowd laughing]\\nWhat would you go by?\\nBrandy Jameson. Brandy Jameson? Is that two alcohols? [group] Yes. You put some thought into this. I love that. I… I say you go for it. How old are you? Thirty-four. Yeah, you missed it.\\nAll right. Okay, never mind.\\n[crowd laughing] [grunts] That is… That’s 40 in gay. [crowd laughing] You’re 34? You look fantastic, dude. Don’t tell me that. No, you look great. We should all get more facials. You look great, dude. You look incredible, man. Congratulations, brother. Listen, if that’s a passion of yours, and you can appreciate the environment and the art form, I say you go for it. I really do. [crowd cheering] Okay, I want to pivot just slightly. I wanna talk about a different kind of dream. [chuckling] Because we’ve tackled enough aspirations for the evening. ‘Cause aspirational dreams aren’t your only dreams, right? You dream every night in your sleep. We all have sleep dreams. Minus me. I’m a terrible sleeper. It’s why I wanna talk about this. I sleep so little, I rarely get a chance to remember my dreams. When I do, they never make any sense. And they’re usually nightmares. I always have scary dreams, reoccurring too. I have… I have the teeth falling out dream a lot.\\n[woman] Yes.\\nYou guys have that one? Oh, thank God, dude. When people have never had it, you sound like a psychopath. If you’ve never had this dream before, you’ll be having a regular dream, right? And your teeth will just start falling out of your mouth. Take your tongue, press it to the back of your top teeth. That little pressure makes your teeth just Tom and Jerry out of your mouth. You’re sloshing them around in your mouth. It’s disgusting. I’ll tell you how fucking crazy I am. I started to have that dream within the dream. So usually you wake up… [groans] …check for your teeth, still there. Like, “Oh, thank God.” I started to have it within the dream. I’d wake up… [gasps] Grab for my teeth, they’d still be gone. I’d wake up again… [gasps] …check again, they’d finally be back. I’m so crazy, my brain was like, “You not gonna get used to this.”\\n[crowd laughing]\\nThat’s what fascinates me about dreams ’cause I started to read books on the subconsciousness of what your dreams could possibly be about. That one, specifically, is usually chalked up to stress. Uh, stress about money, more specifically. I also heard it means you secretly want to be able to suck dick better. So, I mean, in theory, that couldn’t hurt. How could it? There’s no teeth in there. So I’m curious, has anybody ever had a similar experience with a reoccurring nightmare throughout their life that’s haunted them?\\nYou have?\\n[woman] Yes. What have you been dealing with? Uh, since I was about 12, I have a witch that chases me through the woods, and I get to the edge of a cliff, a cliff, and I have to jump or I have to face the witch.\\nPhew. What do you usually do?\\nJump.\\n[exhales]\\n[crowd laughing]\\nI fucking jump. I fucking jump.\\nOkay. [Matt] Okay, now… [exhales] How often do you have this nightmare? Pretty often. Twice a week, maybe, since I was 12.\\nTwice a week?\\n[woman] Yeah. Is this your husband? Yes, this is my husband, and my 21-year-old, my birthday girl. Happy bi',\n",
       "  'rthday. [crowd cheering] We don’t care for the next five minutes, that’s all. I’m 47, by the way.\\nI know.\\n[woman] So I don’t… [crowd laughing] [chuckling] I’m the witch now. [crowd laughing] Husband, have you heard about this dream before?\\n[man] Yes, I have.\\nOkay. Does she wake you up out of your sleep? Like, “I had a scary dream”? Yeah. Or I pick her up from it. You pick her up?\\nShe’s actively having a night terror?\\n[woman] Yeah. And you pick her up and, what? Just kind of swaddle her? [crowd laughing] [chuckling] Where do you pick her up to? Back on the bed.\\n[Matt] Does she fall off the bed?\\nYeah. That’s the cliff you’re jumping from? Fucking three feet? [crowd laughing] Yeah, it’s not as dramatic now. It’s not as high of stakes. Okay. Do you ever get a chance to see the witch? Do they have any distinct features? The witch usually has a blank face that completely freaks me out. So the no-face freaks me out, but she’s got long silver hair. Is the witch wearing his hat by chance?\\n[crowd laughing]\\n[Matt] Okay, I just wanted to make sure. I had a similar nightmare when I was around… This was actually the experience that made me believe in ghosts. When I was about 11, we moved into this farmhouse, in the countryside of Ohio, where I’m from. This house was 120 years old. It creeped me out from the day we moved in. Lived there eight months. The first four, I wouldn’t even sleep in my own room. I slept on my sister’s floor because I was terrified of this house. So after about four months of it, I moved rooms, from my room upstairs to downstairs, what was our computer room. Remember you used to have a computer room? You’re just fighting LimeWire and printing porn all day. The computer room was like the size of this stage. It was just enough room for my bed, my dresser, TV stand, and a closet. I loved how small it was because nothing could hide in there. You know? It was just my space. But then, one day… This still fucks me to this day. It’s one of those things. I don’t know if I was dreaming, but I didn’t wake up again. So I’m asleep, I open my eyes, and there’s just an old woman, kind of faceless, but I can still see a mouth. Frail, like just skin and bones, and like a black veil dress, and she was dead. Again, no face, just a mouth, was leaning over me… If the stool is my face. …and was just frozen with the face…\\n[woman] Oh my God.\\n[crowd exclaims]\\nIt’s one of those things, I don’t know… It had to have been a sleep paralysis, ’cause I could not get my boxers down fast enough. She was definitely… [crowd laughing and clapping] [exhales] She was basically asking for it, you know what I mean? So… But I’m not… I’m not kidding. She, at some point, then just stands up, turns, and walks into my closet. This is the part that fucks with me. I just started my day. There was no point I woke up again like, “That must have been a dream.” I remember just getting out of bed and doing my day. It was one the most terrifying experiences I’ve ever had. Then I got on a Ouija board that night, and I was like, “You up?” [crowd laughing] “Round two. Ha!” Oh. But similar circumstance. Faceless, terrifying woman, kind of sleep-related. Have you ever faced her? You said you choose to jump every time. Have you ever turned and been like, “What’s up, bitch? Square up”? [woman] Yeah, but there’s no face.\\nJust no face.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I jump. There’s no face, so I jump. You don’t have to ’cause she doesn’t have a face. Fucking body shots. You gotta work the liver. I can’t move. I just jump. Oh, that’s terrifying. I’m sorry you deal with that on such a frequent basis. That’s terrifying. I imagine it interrupts most of your good nights of sleep. Maybe. Don’t ask him about your sleep. [crowd laughing] I’m usually on the floor, paralyzed, if we’re still asleep.\\n[Matt] She really falls off the bed?\\nYeah.\\nSometimes.\\nWow. What size bed? You got a king-size?\\n[woman] Yeah.\\nOkay, yeah. Women sleep in the middle of the bed, I don’t know why you’re even concerned. So selfish. I wouldn’t be surprised because he has to take the sheets back, like, “Eh!” [crowd laughing] She’s just like… [crowd laughing] “Oh, baby!” “Baby!” “You had another sleep nightmare.” “You’re having a bad dream.”\\n[crowd laughing]\\nThat is fucking perfect. The exact example I’m looking for. I love this. Witches are terrifying. I love that stuff. Thank you for sharing something so specific. Okay, who has another fun reoccurring nightmare?\\n[woman] I have one sometimes. I’m back here. Hi. Sorry. I have one sometimes that my boyfriend is cheating on me. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. On behalf of every man here, stop it right now.\\n[crowd laughing]\\nI’m so sick of this shit, man. You get a great night’s sleep, no witches or nothing. You get a great night’s sleep. “Good morning, baby.” “Whose baby?” [crowd laughing] Okay, so walk me through what he didn’t do. [crowd laughing] I mean, it’s usually an ex or something. Or ma',\n",
       "  'ybe someone we know. I know he didn’t do it, but I’m still a little mad. You know that’s crazy, right? This is him? This is current boyfriend? Give me an example of a casual dream you have right now. Something you’ve dreamed of that you have any memory of. I don’t dream, I smoke weed.\\n[crowd laughing]\\n[crowd cheering]\\nDid you bring enough for the rest of the class? [crowd laughing] If he’s cheating on you with anybody, it’s Mary Jane. That’s for everybody. You know what I mean? Oh, I love it. I have to do the exact same thing. Is that why I don’t dream?\\nIs there a correlation in that?\\nYeah. Oh, fuck! I’m not gonna stop. I’m not gonna. How often do you have this dream? Not a lot. Maybe once every week or two. [crowd laughing] Hey, man, let’s get the fuck out of here. Let’s start you a new life immediately. Do not torture this man like this. I don’t always bring it up. That’s not the crazy part! The crazy part is that you have it in the first place. I promise I will not pry. Has there been any incident of mistrust between the two of you at any point? Not him and I, but I’ve had some crazy shit with men. So let’s not project onto your new relationship. [crowd cheering] Man. She’s the witch in his dreams, by the way. [crowd laughing] Oh, that… You poor guy. He seems nice as hell. He smokes weed, he don’t have the energy to cheat.\\n[crowd laughing]\\nAre you kidding? Weed makes you a lot of things. Hungry, happy, sleepy. It don’t make you cheat. Listen, Matt. I’ve been catfished by, like, someone I met in person. Wait, hold on. How do you do that? [woman] So I met him, and he was cute, we started talking, go on a couple dates… You realize you making him hear this right now, right? You asked. No, I didn’t, actually. Actually, I didn’t. Rewind the tape right now. I wanna… She said… [tape rewinding] Listen, Matt. Listen, Matt. I’ve been catfished… [in slow motion] I’ve been catfished. I know exactly what you’re going through.\\n[crowd laughing]\\n[Matt laughs] Dude! Oh! Okay. Okay. So you went on a date with a guy, he was cute. How did he catfish you if you met him already? Okay. So we go on a couple dates, and he’s like, really talking all this really wonderful thing. He owns this IT company. He’s a millionaire. He’s balling. So things are going well, we keep talking, and then, all of a sudden, you know, I stop hearing from him as much, and so I do some research. Oh, right there, shouldn’t have done that. Let’s see where it leads. So, I end up finding his ex-girlfriend, and he… Did you message his ex-girlfriend?\\nSo there’s a…\\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no! No. There’s nothing. It’s a yes or no question. No. She found… Oh. Ah! Ah! Witch! [crowd laughing] [Matt] Burn her! Oh, dude! You can’t take that out on him. I’m sorry you’ve had negative experiences in the past, but if he hasn’t done anything, you can’t take that out on him. If you had dreams about past experiences, other people cheating on you, I get that. Suppressed trauma that maybe didn’t get worked out between you and that person. But give this motherfucker a chance, please. All right? [applause] [Matt] Oh, boy. I wanna ask about one more type of dream. Only because I’ve never experienced it. People swear it’s a real thing. I don’t have any proof of it.\\nIs a wet dream a real thing?\\n[woman] Yes. No, but here’s the thing. I don’t mean a sexy dream. Everyone’s had hot dreams. You wake up, “That was hot. Let me go back and finish.” But you never go back to the same dream, so then you’re just hard in like Vietnam or something. You’re like, “I swear I was in a different place a couple minutes ago.” So I don’t mean just a hot dream.\\nI mean has anyone ever had…\\n[man] I got a good one.\\n[Matt] Right in the back there.\\nOne time.\\nOne time?\\nOne time only. Okay. When was this experience? Basic Training. [crowd laughing] Okay. Walk me through this, please. So, every time before or since, you have a sex dream, it’s very frustrating, it never happens. You’ve been chasing the same nut in your sleep the entire time. You’re like that squirrel from Ice Age. You keep chasing the same one in your dreams.\\n[man] Trying to get it.\\nThat first one was that good? Basic Training, I imagine you 18, 19, 20, something like that?\\n[man] Yeah.\\nDid you come out of it?\\nOr was it in the dream?\\nNo, it came out of it. [chuckling] You… “It came out of it.” Hey, shooters are gonna shoot.\\nYou gotta shoot your shot when you can.\\nYeah. So when you woke up there was just a spot. Yeah. I would not like that. [crowd laughing] You just wake up, and there’s just come on your bed? I have a roommate, so my first instinct would be, “This better be mine.” [crowd laughing] How do you deal with that in Basic Training? I imagine there’s bunks. Everybody’s bunk has to be pristine and clean. You said what?\\nI was on the top bunk.\\nYou were on top bunk? Goddamn it, dude! Oh! Your bottom bunkmate just woke up with Halloween',\n",
       "  ' decorations on the sides? Just webbed up. Okay, okay, okay. So we know guys have them, which I feel really like I missed out. Does anyone have a female’s perspective on a wet dream?\\nYou have one?\\n[woman] That’s why I’m single. We’ll see. We’ll see if that’s why. Okay, walk me through this wet dream scenario. What happened? [woman] Um… The… The family thing. Daddy-daughter.\\nReal thing.\\n[group] What? Hold on, hold on, hold on. Don’t just assume like we know the thing. What’s… What is daddy-daughter thing?\\nThey all knew, just now.\\nThey what?\\n[woman] They all knew.\\nWho knew?\\n[woman] Everybody.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo. They gave the same reaction I did, I promise. What is the daddy-daughter thing? Is it a physical relationship with… No, I’ve never met my dad.\\nOh, a daddy issue thing.\\n[woman] Yeah. That’s not how you say that! I don’t know how to say that. Are you kidding me? That’s not how you say that. We all thought you were fucking your dad. Every single person in here. Oh my God. Okay, daddy issue. Got it. How does that equate to a wet dream? You wake up and you’re… Phew! You can’t go back to sleep. Can’t go back to sleep? Because you’re so flustered. You wake up hot and heavy. Can’t go back to sleep without taking care of it. And then the porn you look up is… [crowd laughing] The porn you look up is father-daughter. Man, we went so far off the tracks. How does all of this equate to why you’re single for a week? What happened? Don’t look around like he’s in here. Who are you looking for? Joaquin Phoenix from Joker, sit down. You know what? Here’s the thing about this moment right now. Next time you guys see some haters in my comments going, “All he does is crowd work. It’s so easy.” Is it?\\n[crowd laughing]\\nIs it the easiest shit I could ever do? Is it just handed to me? No!\\n[crowd cheering]\\n[laughs] Damn it, dude. [applause] Oh my goodness. Okay. Yes, ma’am. You raised your hand her whole story. I’m so sorry I didn’t call on you first. I am so sorry. Yes, ma’am. So as far as those type of dreams go, sometimes to get myself to sleep, I may think of other things, but I was just on a cruise for my birthday, and my friend really got upset ’cause she said I moaned in my sleep. I was so disgusted. I was like, “I’m so sorry.” She was like, “You did it in the hotel, you did it loud.” She was like, “I thought you were touching yourself.” I was like, “I was never. I was fast asleep.” Now, was it like… was it a sexual moan? Was it like, “Ooh”?\\n[woman] That’s what she said it was.\\nOr was it… [grunts] …like sleep apnea? You know how a stepdad snores? [loud snore] [loud snore] Any recollection what this dream was about? Like who the co-star may have been? Who usually crosses your mind?\\nIt was my ex.\\n[Matt] Your ex? Ooh. That’s tough. Oh, so the dick was good. Yeah. [crowd laughing] [Matt] That’s tough. Do you… Do you think he knows you still think about it? [grunts]\\n[woman] He dropped me off at the airport.\\nWhat’s that?\\nDropped me at the airport for my cruise.\\nHe dropped you? [sucks teeth] Okay. Let me ask you this. You don’t have to go into specifics if it’s bad. But what did he do that was so bad that it overrode good dick? He’s in the process of getting divorced.\\n[crowd member] Oh!\\n[Matt] Wait.\\nThey’re separated.\\n[Matt] He’s getting a divorce?\\nThey were already separated?\\n[woman] Yeah. By how many inches were they separated? [crowd laughing] How long ago was this relationship? [woman] Seven inches. [crowd laughing] White or Black?\\nHe’s Black.\\nBlack? Yeah, he’s not seven inches. No. It’s not seven inches. [crowd laughing] I don’t drop off nobody at the airport. I got Uber Pool dick at best, dude. You gotta… We’ll have some fun, but you gotta make some stops. You know? [chuckling] You’ll have to converse with a stranger. Okay. Oh, that’s fucking tough. That’s tough. When you would have these wet dreams, were they ever… You mentioned your friend said you were moaning. Were they ever to the point of completion? I don’t know. I didn’t wanna get that deep into it. Sounds like he was as deep as humanly possible. This motherfucker was almost in your subconscious. Um… [sighs] See, that’s interesting. This put it into perspective. This is always an ongoing debate about, like… Women always feel like they’re more sexual than men, and you’re not. You’re not. You’ve never jacked off going 85 on the freeway…\\n[crowd laughing]\\n…’cause a good song came on, you know what I mean? Every dude here has tried to beat “Free Bird” in traffic. We’re fucking gross, man. I don’t think there needs to be any competition. Both parties have wet dreams. I think we’re closer than you think. I think guys are creepier about how sexual we are, but I think women are freakier about how sexual they are. You ladies are fucking gross, dude. You guys do too much, man. You guys do some nasty shit. You realize we don’t even ask you to sometimes? Fellas, your girl ever do some nasty shit in the bedroom, and you’',\n",
       "  're like, “Ew!” [crowd laughing] “Put it back!”\\n[crowd laughing]\\nWe never wanna discourage you, so we’re always like, “I love that shit.” Sometimes we’re like, “What the fuck?” You guys be doing too much, dude. I think I’m good in bed until I hear what other people are doing. I don’t want any part of that shit at all. Ladies, I’m gonna say this one time. One time only. You leave our buttholes alone! If we want it, we’ll fucking ask for it, okay? I don’t know what this invasive TikTok trend y’all are on now, shut it down. All right? You don’t sell it well. If I find out it’s one of your techniques, I’ll lose my fucking mind. ‘Cause it always gets brought up in that situation. Girls are like, “Well, let me just put a finger in while I’m giving you head.” “It’ll feel so good.” It already feels the best! Okay? I don’t need to blow a hole through the fucking drywall to prove I had a good time, dude. It’s always a chick with acrylic nails. Are you fucking crazy? Are you out of your mind? Keep your Bugle claws out of me, bitch. You guys know what Bugles are? [chuckles] I didn’t think that reference was gonna land at all. You guys are white trash, man. That is… That is a gas station chip, dude. Do not put that in your body.\\nOh my God. Charlotte, man. I want to thank you guys for… for being respectful, hearing other people’s stories. Everybody who talked to me, thank you for opening up about personal details of your life that, outside of this environment, would be absolutely insane to ever talk about. So thank you. But I wanted to do this show about dreams because every single person in this room made my dream come true. If there’s anything I can do to encourage you guys to pursue your dreams, I hope every single one of them comes true. This was Netflix’s first crowd work special. I didn’t wanna do it anywhere else. Charlotte, you made my dreams come true. I can’t wait to see what’s next.\\n[crowd cheering and clapping]\\n[“Sweet Dreaming of You” by Brandon Combs playing]\\n♪ One-way ticket on a moonlight flight ♪\\n♪ Boarding as I fall asleep tonight ♪\\n♪ Till we’re together What else can I do? ♪\\n♪ But shut my eyes And hope my dreams come true ♪\\n♪ I’ll be sweet, sweet, Sweet dreaming of you ♪\\n♪ Ooh ♪\\n♪ All night long, our love song ♪\\n♪ Lasts for hours on and on, oh babe ♪\\n♪ Who may be Don’t shake me ♪\\n♪ Unless is you I wake to see Oh, love ♪\\n♪ One-way ticket on a moonlight flight ♪\\n♪ Boarding when I fall asleep tonight ♪\\n♪ Till we’re together What else can I do? ♪\\n♪ But shut my eyes And hope my dreams come true ♪\\n♪ I’ll be sweet, sweet Sweet dreaming of you ♪\\n♪ I’ll be sweet dreaming Till it comes true ♪\\n[music fades]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nMatt Rife, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Hey, thank you. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We’re here. This is crazy. It’s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don’t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I’m arguing with. And the reason it’s a source of tension is that I’m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, “Well, you don’t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.” And I was like, “No, I think it’s insane, you know, for anyone.” And she said, “Why?”\\nAnd I said, “Well, first of all, it just seems doomed.” You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That’s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That’s a learning curve.\\nSecond of all, monogamy’s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I’m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we’re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, “Well, we like sex just as much as you do.” And I said, “Sure, but it’s different.” And they say, “How?” And I say, “Have you ever masturbated while driving a car?”\\nNumber three… I’m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that’s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn’t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that’s the hopeful part.\\nThe, uh… I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he’s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren’t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were… we were pretty good. I mean, we weren’t like the best in the world. I’m sure there are better in Europe. But we were… we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, “Are you sure this is what you want to do?” And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren’t friends anymore.\\nSo February 27, 2007, I’m at Andy’s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation ’cause he’s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you’re right. He says stuff like, “She sounds crazy.” Like, even if what she’s saying isn’t that crazy, like, you’d be like, “She only eats whole wheat bagels.” He’d be like, “She sounds crazy!” You’d be like, “That’s not even the crazy part!” You know. So I’m telling him about his argument. And he goes, “You’re right.” I go, “I know. I’m right.” He goes, “Yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know I’m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.” And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I’m driving out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned! I don’t know if you’re familiar with this term, uh… This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver’s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know.\\nLet me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh… No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I’ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, “What are you doing?” And I said, “I’m writing my set list.” And then she goes, “I think it’ll be fine.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be fine.” And then she was like, “I think it will be okay.” And I said, “Why do you think that?” And she said, “Well, you look so nervous, I think they’ll feel sorry for you.” But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, “It seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.” Normally, I’d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, “You are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.” She re… she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean… I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I… I’d jus… I’d just come off a really long, diffi\",\n",
       "  'cult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and… and then we weren’t. And then when we weren’t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and… But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didn’t… I didn’t think it was gonna happen.\\nLike, I don’t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I’m seeing a girl, she’d think, “I’d have sex with him, maybe.” You know, and I’m… I’m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just don’t give off a great first impression. Like, I’ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn’t… I didn’t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my “A” outfit. My “B” outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I’ve reached this point in my life I don’t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I’m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like… But I don’t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I’m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I’m like, “Come on!” “You’re blind if you’re leaving the house like that!” And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it’s a close game ’cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I’m all riled up. I’m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I’m like, “Next time.” You know, that’s how I go for fried dough, ’cause I have a problem. I just…\\nThis is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I’m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I’ve been going, uh, recently to a women’s exercise class. I-I’ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I’m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh… It’s going pretty well, you know. I’m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I’ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn’t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I’ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they’ll have those… The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while… And I’m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they’ll fall, and it’s ugly ’cause they’re rolling around like, “I’m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don’t even know how I got here.” But at the end of that, no matter what… And I totally fall for it. I’m like, “that can’t possibly be the same loser “From moments ago. “I mean, that’s a completely different person. “This person has much better posture, for starters.”\\nI really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis ’cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don’t know, and, uh… I didn’t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh… Pfft. Which… yeah, I don’t know if that was the best idea ’cause, uh, we’re heading… We’re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, “Oh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.” And I was like, “Oh, we can just swing back and get it.” And she’s like… she’s like, “No, it’ll be fine.” I was like, “No, it won’t be fine ’cause it’s St. Patrick’s day, and there’s bouncers.” And she goes, “No, it’ll be okay.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be okay.” And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they’re like birthday clowns like, you know, “What can I do to make your day better?”\\nYou know, and that’s… We’re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn’t the idea. And so I said… I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh… But she warmed to me as the night went on ’cause she was drinking, and then, like… No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we… I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and… We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, “Sure.” We get to her door, and I didn’t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, “Oh, no, thank you.” Which I thought was polite… But disappointing. I mean, there’s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you’re really putting yourself out there. You’re just like, “I think we should connect mouths,” you know, and… The other person’s like, “I do not think we should connect mouths.” And those are… They’re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You’re like, “I never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.”\\nThis is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I… I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I r',\n",
       "  'emember… I remember it like it was yesterday ’cause I was shocked. I was like, “People we know are just making out with other people we know?” “But how?” You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, “I am not doing that.” And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, “That is fine. “You are not on the list. “You’re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.” I was like, “Perfect.” It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, “I don’t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.” And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It’s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That’s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that’s right? Okay, good.\\nSo… In seventh grade, I was like, “I’m not gonna make out with anybody.” And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, “we call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. “First order of business, Nintendo. “Second order of business, why doesn’t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.” I don’t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared… I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, “I got to try to get into the make-out club.” But it was a very intangible goal. I didn’t really talk to a lot of girls, and… There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had… I don’t… The rest of the show is in old English. Uh… She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, “Oh, this is great. I got to do that more.” And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well ’cause she goes, “Mike, you got to stop. I’m gonna pee myself.” And I was like, “Wow.” This was the closest I’d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that’s how I ended up here. Yeah. That’s how we all ended up here, in a sense.\\nSo… uh… So here’s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn’t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, “Well, maybe this will be like “one of those romantic comedy montages. “We’ll go to the carnival, we’ll get stuck “On the top of the Ferris wheel, we’ll make out. “It’ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.” But I think that when you’re 12 years old, you just don’t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don’t know that you shouldn’t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It’s basically saying, “We’re gonna take sugar, “which everyone knows is bad, but then we’ll dress it up like insulation.” And I’m like, “I’m not sure “what the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?” They’re like, “We already sold it.” I’m like, “well done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.” I don’t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the “shits of pants-erator,” and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said… They said, “We like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy says, “Well, what about the ‘I think I’m gonna die-erator’?” And they’re like, “That’s good, “’cause it gets across the essence of how you feel “when you’re on the machine. “Plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, “which is a nice homage “to the original intention of the machine, “but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy goes, “well, what about the scrambler? ‘Cause it scrambles you!” They’re like, “We get it, Frank, but who…” Frank is a maniac. This guy can’t be stopped, but every once in a while, he’s got a good idea. “But who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?” And this one guy goes, “well, I have a nephew who’s 16 years old “and smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.” And they’re like, “he sounds amazing. “We don’t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.”\\nI sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I’m feeling good. Like, she’s snuggling up close to me, and I’m thinking… I’m thinking like, “this could be it. “This could be where it’s all gonna happen. This is very special.” And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It’s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don’t think it’s saved lives. I think the only thing it’s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it’s just sort of held someone’s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don’t talk about scrambler accident. That’s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was ',\n",
       "  'like, “hey, actually…” And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn’t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\\nSo then I’m scrambling, and… As I am scrambling, I’m thinking, “I need to come up with a plan of some kind. I’m not going down without a fight.” My first plan was very simple. It was just don’t look at Lisa, don’t look at any other people. I was like, “don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. “Don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. I need a new plan.” And… The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator… That he needed to stop the ride, but… The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I’m like, “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!” And I’m back! “I’m not sure he heard me. “I got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! “I’m not sure he’s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.” The third time I said, “please stop.” And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just… Popcorn, peanuts… Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I’m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening.\\nTwo years later, it gets worse. Um… I’m at the St. John’s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John’s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So… Cattle shows up at 8:00. We’ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that ’cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss ’cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, “oh, have you had your first kiss?” I’d be like, “yeah, like, all the time. Like, every… every week.” I always feared at some point there’d be a follow-up question like, “oh, yeah? What’s it like?” And I’d be like, “yeah, you know, it’s just like licking an ice cream cone.” And they’d be like, “no, it’s not. It’s like sucking on a rocket pop.” And I’d be like, “ah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.” I’m at the dance, and I’m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we’re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, “moo!” And we were like, “moo!” And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we’ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, “you get that one.” Which I know it’s the worst turn of phrase, but I’m comfortable saying it ’cause I know I’ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, “you get that one.” And then her friend goes like, “oof.” You know, or even worse… or even worse, like, “you owe me,” which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone’s credit score, you know. So he goes… he goes, “you get that one.” And then I’m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc’s bust a move. And I’m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it’s only catching me one out of every five… Hey! So she’s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then I’m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What’s great about slow dancing is you can’t really mess it up ’cause it’s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She’d be like, “what are you doing?” And I’d be like, “I don’t pick up on social cues,” you know. But it’s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I’m just trying not to fidget. I’m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn’t know anything about making out, but I’d seen people do it. I could see there’s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no… You know, there’s no video documentation of that area. It’s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They’ve only seen it washed up on the shore… Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but… So I’m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo… All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, “oh, no. I don’t want to be alone anymore.” And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it’s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery ’cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, “I’m not alone anymore! I’m not in the non-make-out club!” And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn’t because up until that point, I’d lied and said that I’d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, “how’d it go, dude?” I had to be like, “same as always. Pretty smooth.”\\nAs the week wore on, I started to convince myself, “well, maybe it did go well, “and I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,” but… I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didn’t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, “hey, you like full house? “Me neither. Cool. All right. Later.” ',\n",
       "  'You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, “why are you calling me?” And I remember thinking, “oh, I’m probably reading into that one too much,” and… And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, “oh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.” But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn’t even tell my friends, until one day I was… I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, “hey, what’s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn’t called me back.” And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom’s like, “oh.” “I talked to Sandra, and she said “you’re the worst kisser she’s ever kissed.” And it was so devastating ’cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn’t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn’t say, “that makes sense. I’ve never done that before.” So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, “yeah, that sounds about right. “I’m a terrible kisser. That’s kind of my thing.”\\nSo I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, “oh, no, thank you.” She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn’t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We’re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, “everyone hates me at work,” and I said, “why would they hate you? I love you.” She goes, “you love me?” I go, “I mean, you seem cool.” I pulled it back. I didn’t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, “you know, sometimes I’ll date two people at once, and that way I’m never let down by either person.” I said, “that seems like a really smart plan. Like, I’d like to do that as well.” And she said, “I’m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you’re seeing them.” And I was like, “all right, sounds like a plan. “Got it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.” And so a few nights later, I’m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I’m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, “how was your trip?” And I said, “it was great. I did some shows, “and then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.” And that didn’t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, “but I’m right about that, right? Like, I’m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?” And she says, “yeah, but it doesn’t mean “that I won’t lose interest in you.” And I said, “that’s a whole new clause! “That’s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?” I said, “are you still seeing John?” And she said, “sometimes.” I said, “well, don’t you see the contradiction in that?” And she says, “yes.” And it gets very quiet… Because we were falling in love.\\nThree weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn’t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda ’cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it’s winter in New York, it is also winter… In Bermuda, and, uh… Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she’s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I’m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And… and Jenny’s late. And then we get to security, and I’m not making this up, she doesn’t have a license or a passport. And I said, “what do you mean?” I go, “how do you travel?” And she goes, “well, “usually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.” I don’t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can’t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what… what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they’re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn’t want that, unless they’re lesbians, although there’s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda… Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although… then they’d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, “I didn’t even know I was a lesbian “until I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. “And now that’s all I’m into. “I used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, “they’d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me “and 71 of my friends. But now I don’t see Khalid in the same way anymore.”\\nThe point is, we went to Bermuda, and we’re on the flight… On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, “congratulations on your honeymoon.” And we said, “oh, no, thanks. We’re not on our honeymoon.” And she walks away, and Jenny says, “that’s so funny. I don’t think I’ll ever go on a honeymoon.” And I said, “oh, really?” And she goes, “yeah. I don’t think I’d ever want to get married in my life.” And I said, “oh, really?” I go, “me too.” I said, “is that based on a principle, “or did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?” And… She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was… they were at the same bus stop when',\n",
       "  ' they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they… you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, “then what?” And she said, “he died. He had leukemia.” And I said, “well, do you ever talk about this with anyone?” And she says, “no, I don’t really like to talk about it.” But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we’d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we… At one point, I was like, “well, we should do this again. “We should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.” Jenny said, “that sounds great, “but I don’t think I’d get a license or a passport ’cause they don’t make me get one.” And I was like, “yeah, but it’s the law.” You know. Jenny says, “yeah, I don’t think I’ll get one “’cause they don’t make me get one, you know. That’s how I feel.” That’s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she’ll just say, “that’s how I feel.” And I’ll say, “that’s not an argument.” “Like, we’re not even in an argument right now because you don’t have an argument.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument.” And I’ll say, “that’s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument,” again. “That’s how I feel.”\\nYou could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh… On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, “we should play.” And I was like, “yeah, but not, like, a game.” And she said, “why?” And I said, “well, ’cause I’d win.” And she said, “no, I think I would win.” I go, “no. I know that I’d win, “and I know that what I’m supposed to say is that… “The guy says, ‘I’ll win,’ the girl says, ‘I’ll win,’ “and the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don’t have that in me.” And Jenny goes, “you don’t have to let me win. Let’s go out and play.” And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like… It was just like… 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, “I’ve never met someone who’s so obsessed with the score.” And I said, “the score is what makes it a game!”\\nSo we’re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we’re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, “I don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with being right.” I go, “I’m not obsessed with it. I just am.” I said, “why do you think you’re right?” And she says, “that’s how I feel.” I said, “if you think I’m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?” And Jenny says, “you can’t choose who you love.” Which is true, but it doesn’t mean it’s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you’re just like, “this is it. I found her. I’m 17 years old, and I’m done, you know.” And… Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, “it was totally messed up because it wasn’t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.” And I was just like, “awesome.” Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just… I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, “do you want to write an article for the newspaper?” She goes, “I don’t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.” And I was like, “good answer.”\\nI find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She’d be like, “no one likes you at all. Only kidding.” Or, like, “you’re like a nerd, but you’re not even smart. Just joking.” Can’t choose who you love.\\nSecond red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don’t… I don’t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a… It’s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You’d know when he was lying ’cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he’d go, “yeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.” And he wasn’t even handling money. Like, I don’t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He’d be like, “yeah, my uncle’s Tony Robbins, “motivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.” And… We found out that that wasn’t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn’t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that’s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you’re lying about big stuff. It’s like banking.\\nThe final red flag with Amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I’m in the future also. I think we can all see now ’cause we’re so smart, and Mike’s so dumb, and, uh… You know, I can also see, in retrospect, that’s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time ’cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, “well, this is the affirmation ',\n",
       "  'that I need. I’m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.” And I drive my mom’s station wagon to Amanda’s parents’ house, and I walk in the front door, and there’s Amanda, and there’s her parents, and it’s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I’m assuming he’s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I’m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They’re both in their first year in college, and they’re competitive wrestlers, and… It’s dawning on me that I’m hanging out with my girlfriend’s boyfriend. And it’s going pretty well. I mean, he… He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, “I wish it were just you and me here.” And I remember thinking, “you could make that happen.” The way she said it was as though she weren’t involved in the decision process, like, “I’d love to, but the boys in corporate…”\\nWell, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend’s boyfriend’s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you’re like… “Maybe if this goes well, she’ll see that I’m good with adults in general!” As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, “how do you know Amanda?” And I said, “we’re just friends from school.” And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, “I am never gonna let this happen to me again.”\\nSo… Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize ’cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful ’cause it was… In Texas. And I… that’s… That’s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It’s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh… But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is… which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy… I love comedy clubs ’cause they’re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they’re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there’s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they’re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That’s… that’s actually a thing. I didn’t even realize that… I didn’t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was… was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if… And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I… but that’s… that’s not my job. I’m… you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just… I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And… I’d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, “whatever I can do to help. I don’t see how this could end badly.” And, uh… The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I’m hung over, and I’m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I’m still two hours early, and… I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny’s parents’ house. And I walk in the front door, and there’s Jenny, and there’s her parents. And there’s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn’t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, “well, what’s John doing here?” And she says, “well, he and I aren’t still together, “but when we were together, “he became friends with my stepdad, “and he’s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.” And I said, “you know, that’s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.” Jenny’s staring at me. And I said, “what?” She says, “you have a hickey on your neck.” And I said, “I don’t think that’s true.” And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, “I’m really sorry.” And she says, “where is that from?” And I said, “there was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.” That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there’s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and… We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn’t have a leg to stand on. I was like, “well, what about John? What was he doing there?” She said, “you have a hickey on your neck.” I said, “yeah, but at least I told you the truth.” And she said, “eventually.” And I said, “eventually is better than never!” And then she kneed me in the balls. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this before. I’m sure half of you have not. Uh… It’s like being electrocuted, except you don’t get to die. It’s like you want to die, but you can’t. And there’s a person in your face saying, “you deserve this,” which they wouldn’t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.\\xa0 Even in Texas.\\nJenny says, “I think that we should just break up. “You know, it’s not just this. “I mean, you’re away a lot of the time. “And even when you’re here, you work at night, “and I work in the day. I just don’t think it’s gonna work out.” And I said, “okay.”\\xa0 And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her ’c',\n",
       "  'ause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I’d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” And it would just say, “hi.” And I’d write back, “hi.” It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year’s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, “hey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.” And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, “what?” And she says, “I think that we should live together.” And I said, “no, I really don’t think that’s a good idea. “You know, I’ve just decided, you know, as a principle, “I’m not gonna get married or live with someone. It’s not personal.” And she said, “well, unless we live together, “I just don’t think it’s gonna work out “’cause we just don’t see each other enough, “and I don’t think that we stand a chance. That’s how I feel.”\\nSo we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, “oh, no, thanks.” That doesn’t go over so well. She says, “why?” And I said, “well, as you know, “I don’t believe in marriage, and so I don’t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.” She said, “well, what do you believe in?” And I said, “I don’t know.” She said, “well, if you don’t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?” And I said, “well, first of all, “you know, it just doesn’t seem necessary. “I mean, is it… you know, “marriage is an archaic institution “invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. “I don’t want to be a part of that. “Second of all, I don’t even think we have “a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. “I mean, one of me and Andy’s friends “was about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, “and we said, ‘are you sure this is the person “you want to be with for the rest of your life?’ “and he goes, ‘yeah, I think so.’ “and we said, ‘well, what if she gets in a car accident, “and she’s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?’ “and he said, ‘maybe’! “That is not an acceptable answer! “Third of all, if I’m so in love, “why does it need to be written into a government contract? “And I’m not one of these like, “‘I don’t want government up in my business’ kind of people! “I think the government does a nice job “delivering the mail and suggesting I don’t eat poison, “but I just don’t understand why they need to be involved “in my personal relationships. “Then finally, if marriage is religious, “shouldn’t I believe in the religion? “I’ve been to more weddings of my friends “where the people on the altar don’t believe “in the religion of the church they’ve invited us to! “Some of them even go to classes with the priest “in advance, to more elaborately lie “about believing in a religion they don’t believe in “just to have a wedding in a fancy building! “That is insane! That’s how I feel!” So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, “well, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.” And I said, “why? Aren’t you listening to any of this?” And Jenny says, “that’s how I feel.”\\nAt this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we’d been arguing all night, and we hadn’t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I’m overtired, and I’m angry, and I’m late. I’m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It’s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn’t even there. There’s a guy with a laptop going, “we need a road, stat! What’s the code for building, tank?” You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn’t even started yet. It’s just an anchor looking around like, “what are you up to?” And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, “well, that ain’t your gate.” Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, “I was not involved in this process. I wasn’t even C.C.’d.” Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, “B22. Like hell I’m flying out of B22.” And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, “this is where I’m going.” You know, I’m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, “well, where is this gate?” She goes, “it’s in another terminal. You got to take a tram.” She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, “and you better run.” Like, I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, “I don’t want to run. I have wheels.” And I was like, “I don’t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. “I tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I’ll walk you in circles for a few hours.” Then I… I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, “perfect. That’s exactly how long I want to wait.” But the tram’s riding away. I was like, “that’s -1 minute!” Then it says ten minutes, and I’m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, “oh, great, I’m gonna miss my flight, “and then I’m gonna miss every flight from now on, “and I’m gonna miss my family reunion. “And then I’m not gonna have a family, and then I’m gonna be a crack whore.” And it’s like, all of a sudden, I’m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and…\\nI get on the',\n",
       "  ' next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I’m sweaty, and I’m out of breath, but I’m on time. And I’m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I’d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I’m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that’s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, “do you know these people?” She was like, “all I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.” I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, “Drew Barrymore’s character, come back!” She didn’t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I’d missed my show. I’d never missed one of my shows before, and I’m so angry. And Jenny’s calling me, but I’m not picking up the phone ’cause I’m blaming this entire day on her.\\nI get back to my friend Andy’s house, and I said, “Andy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!” And Andy goes, “you’re right.” I go, “I know! I’m right!” He goes, “yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know, I’m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!” I drive out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned. That’s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I’m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri… have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that’s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn’t… Doesn’t start crying right away because it doesn’t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it’s like, “oh, I guess I should be doing something “that matches that. Waah!” I’m crying because I’m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don’t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I’d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and… The officer comes over, and he says, “what happened?” And I said, “I got hit by this car, “and then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.” The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can’t help but think, “that’s karma. That’s a hit and run and hit.” And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, “sign this.” And I said, “well, what does it mean?” And he goes, “it means you’re okay and that we can leave.” I was really shaken up. I was like, “I don’t know if I’m okay.” And he goes, “just sign it,” which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you’ve just said no to, and it’s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours ’cause the other driver had beat us there, and… Eventually, we’re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, “well, was the other guy drunk?” And the doctor says, “well, I can’t answer that.” And Andy says, “was he?” He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, “well, he’s heading to jail now.” And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, “case closed.” A few hours later, we’re back at Andy’s house, it’s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, “I need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.” And Andy says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” And I said, “no, no, no, this makes perfect sense.” And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” He saves me.\\nThe next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed… And I’m not making this up… $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver’s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, “well, this can’t be happening.” I explained to the woman, “I think it’s a misunderstanding. “The other guy was clearly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.” And she said, “I’m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.” So I requested the accident report, and I’m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these things before… But it’s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1… that’s me… started to go, but all of a sudden V-1… That’s me also… Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I’m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver’s statement at the scene of the accident was, “I was on Venice going… uh, I’m not too sure. “I was going away from the beach. “I was driving. “I don’t know what happened. “Did I hurt anyone? “I don’t know where I was going, “but I came from home. I had a sip of beer.” Which is really everyone’s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That’s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\\nSo all of it’s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He c',\n",
       "  'hecks the box that finds me at fault. So I’m like, “I need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.” The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know ’cause I’m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I’m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I’m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” I know, and, I mean, that’s what I said. I go, “aren’t you listening to any of this?” I go, “and this guy was clearly drunk. “I mean, he nearly killed me. “Inches from where he hit, “and I would be dead right now. “And he wants me to pay for his car? “Don’t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?” And he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it’s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I’m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There’s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no,” and he says, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no. This isn’t about money.” And he doesn’t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.\\nI’m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy’s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, “Jim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, “but Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.” I was like, “I’m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. “I’m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I’m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!” At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, “hey, what’s going on?” I’d be like, “I’ll tell you what’s going on!” I’d tell them this whole story. And they’d be like, “you should get a lawyer.” I’d be like, “this is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn’t even touch this!” ‘Cause he wouldn’t.\\nThe only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she’s talking to me, but I’m not listening ’cause I’m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I’ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I’m gonna call that week. And I’m so angry, I’m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I’m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, “what are you doing?” And I said, “well, this is my case.” And she says, “well, why don’t you work on that in the morning?” And I said, “well, which part of this napkin don’t you understand?” Jenny says, “Mike… “You’re right, “but it’s only hurting you, “and I’m just so glad that you’re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.” She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy’s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn’t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don’t. But I believe in her, and I’ve given up on the idea of being right.\\nThank you guys very much. Thank you. Thank you guys so much!

I love you.\\nWe love you.\\nAnd now, please welcome my daddy, Nate Bargatze!\\n* * *\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\n[folk rock continues playing]\\n[audience members cheer]\\nAll right. This is it. Uh, this is fun, huh? This is… Yeah. I mean, let me tell you, 2020 has been my favorite year. Out of all the years, this has been the best one. I mean, I don’t… You know, there’s aliens. They said there’s UFOs. And no one cares. That’s… What kind of year could you have that you could sneak in, “Hey, everybody, on the news…” At the end of the news! They go, “There’s UFOs.” You’re like, “Aw, do they have COVID?” And you’re like, “No.” “I don’t know. They won’t get tested.”\\nBut, uh… It’s funny, I told my wife that. I said, “They said there’s UFOs,” and she just went about her day. I mean, just… You might even watch this and be like, “I didn’t hear that.” That’s the point. That’s how amazing 2020 has been.\\nI also feel this is a good year to see where your friends are at. You know? You want to be in the middle, I think. And I’ve got friends that, they take a shower with their mask on, and they sleep with a mask on, ’cause they have a hamster, and the hamster probably has it, and they live alone, it’s just them and the hamster.\\nAnd I also have friends that I don’t think have even heard about COVID. I… It looks like someone told them to try to go get it, that’s how they’re living.\\nI have a lot of friends, too, they tell me they already had it. There’s a big… They’re like, “I had it, I had a fever.” Uh… “February, had a fever for a couple hours, so probably had it.”\\nI had one friend, he told me he had it in 2015. He’s… I mean, convinced. He goes, “I had it in 2015.” “I was the first, and it just didn’t catch on like it has now, but…”\\nI can tell you one thing that’s gone forever is coughing in public. That’s… That’s a wrap. I mean… You drink water wrong at a restaurant, just go walk in traffic. Um… Whole restaurant just stops. Your table would be like, “Get out of here. Get out of here.”\\nYou know who that’ll hurt the most, the cough in public? My parents, ’cause that’s one of their favorite things to do, is cough in public. They love it. That’s all they do. They cough everywhere. My dad’s choking constantly. Just always… If he’s not choking, that’s when we get worried. That’s how much choking… We go to a restaurant, they’re like, “Is your dad okay?” I’m like, “I didn’t…” “Yeah, that’s just what he does.” You know?\\nI’ve been traveling all over the country during this COVID, and what I’ve seen is… Look, in the middle of the country, they’re doing good. I went to a NASCAR race. They had masks, doing what they’re supposed to. A lot of people are doing it, we’re trying. We take our temperature. I went to Buffalo Wild Wings. They took my temperature. You telling me that teenager doesn’t\\xa0know what he’s\\xa0doing?\\xa0Is that what you’re… Don’t think he’s going to doctor school? That’s how they get started, is he takes temperatures, and he’s like, “45 degrees. You’re good.” Uh, yeah, you’re, like, 60 degrees from the problem. So I don’t, you know… And they’re not even worried about it. “Fifty-seven degrees.” You’re like, “Actually, I’m dead, dude.” “That’s not good.” I asked, “Does that even work?” “I don’t know. When it beeps, I just tell them to go ahead.” I… I swear, one kid said, “Beep.” I don’t think his beep worked, and he goes, “Beep.” And I was like, “Was that…” And he goes, “You’re fine.” [Nate chuckles]\\nI’ve done pretty good during COVID. I, uh… ‘Cause I feel like you could either… I lost some weight\\xa0during COVID. You could go two ways. If you wanted to gain weight, this is your time. I mean, everybody’s fine with it. You can just do it, but I’ve been doing all that up until COVID. I’ve always lived by that rule. So during COVID, I was like, “I need to stop.” And my neighbor started working out in his driveway. So he’s like, “Let’s work out in my driveway.” And, you know, it’s hard to make excuses during COVID. You’re like, “I’m just so busy.” “I’m just… I can’t, I got a lot of stuff to do today.” And he’s just out there. So I started to do it with him, and he had a trainer, and I’m not a big fan of working out, never done it. And I told them, “I just wanna do upper-body stuff.” And they go, “All right. Well, how about we just do legs every day?” That’s all it is, is legs. I think it’s a huge conspiracy with trainers that you never actually do your upper body, and when you are doing it… I asked him, “Is this upper body?” He goes, “Yeah.” I go, “Yeah? ‘Cause I’m bending down quite a bit.”\\nWhat I eat, that’s the main problem. I eat like a child. I eat… I mean, it’s not good. He goes, “Let’s go t',\n",
       "  'hrough what you had for breakfast, your whole day of eating.” He goes, “Let’s go through yesterday.” And in my head, I’m like, “Yesterday’s not a good day.” “Let’s pick another day.” Uh… He goes, “Go through yesterday.”\\xa0I go, “All right, I had donuts in the morning.” And he goes, “All right, was it like they were just out or something?” I go, “No, I drove. I drove to it.” “I drove to it.” He’s like, “Is it on your way?” I go, “No, I was late to where I was going because of it.”\\nHe goes, “What about late-night snacking?” I was like, “Well, I had Sour Patch Kids last night.” He goes, “Did you watch a movie?” I go, “No, just regular TV.” And he’s like, “The little kid bag?” I go, “No, it was a bag. It was a bag of ’em.” “If you saw it without a label and someone said, ‘Hand me that bag,’ they wouldn’t be confused on what you were asking.” I always have trouble going to sleep, and I swear, every doctor… It’s like, I eat Sour Patch Kids and have soda, and I’m like, “What’s going on, man? I can’t…” “Dude, at night, my brain just doesn’t stop.” And they’re like, “Yeah, dude, you can’t eat Sour Patch Kids in bed.” “Maybe that’s a problem.”\\nWe’ve been traveling around like crazy. Did all these drive-in dates that have been super fun. I like traveling, love being on the road. I remember one time, I was in Los Angeles, and I was going to South by Southwest in Austin, Texas the next day, and I had a really early flight. I remember the night before, I was like, “Just be normal, have a normal night.” And ended up hanging out, became a bit of a problem. [chuckles] And I wake up the next day, and my flight is gone. I’ve missed it, and it’s not like it’s at the gate, it is in Austin, Texas. They are checking into their hotel. So I go to get my phone to get another flight, and I’ve lost my phone. The night before, I’ve lost it. So now I don’t have my phone. So I have to go buy a ticket over the counter like it’s the ’50s. And when you walk up to a counter, they don’t expect you to be buying a ticket like that. I got up there, and they’re like, “All right.” I was like, “I would like one ticket to Austin, Texas, please.” And they said, “All right, go buy it and don’t be weird about it.” I go, “No, I’d like to write a check to you for one ticket to Austin, Texas.” They didn’t have a flight, so I have to do that at every terminal. I just have keep going, “One ticket to Austin, Texas, please.” I finally found a flight, but the girl\\xa0behind the\\xa0counter, she’s never sold a ticket like that. “I’ve worked here for ten years. No one’s ever done this.” “I don’t know how to do it.” She went back and got probably the oldest lady I’ve ever seen. I think she’s there for just this reason. She came out, she had that old credit card machine that you run. She’s like, “I got it. I’ve been… This is super fun for me.” It was weird to not have my phone. Everybody has their phone. I was going through the airport, and you just don’t have it, and you just stare. I mean, we were waiting in line, and you’re just looking ahead. I mean, people are just like, “All right, dude, what is wrong with you?” Just regular people… Like, “Where’s your phone?” I’m like, “I don’t have it.” “I’d like to talk to you, though, if you’ll talk\\xa0to me.” “I’d love to chat for a little bit.” I thought I was going to breeze through security, but I got held up ’cause of the guy in front of me. He goes through the metal detector, and it goes off, and so they ask him, “Do you have anything metal on you?” And he goes, “I have keys on me, my keys.” And we thought he was gonna say his knee or hip, you know, just… Old people have metal in them a lot. And he goes, “Keys? Do you think that would do it?” You’re like, “That would be the number-one answer on Family Feud of what would set a metal detector off.” “Keys.” I told him, “Look, let’s try it with and without it.” “I’d love to know. Maybe they’ve been lying to us about this key thing.”\\nSo I’ve been doing these drive-in shows, these drive-in movie theater shows, and my buddy Nic Novicki‘s been with me. And Nic’s a little person, very fun. We started comedy together. Nic’s very fun to be friends with, very easy to trick. We were once at a coffee shop, and a guy was sitting near us with a big husky dog. And Nic just goes, “Hey, you think that’s a wolf?” And I just said, “Yeah, I do think it’s a wolf.” Uh… “They just passed a law that if you can catch a wolf, you can have it as a pet.” He goes, “Should I go ask him about it?” I was like, “Absolutely. I mean, he wants to talk about it.” “That’s why he brought that wolf out here.” I watched him walk over to him and just go, “Excuse me, is that a wolf?” And the guy, he didn’t really know how to answer. He’s like, “What?” “I mean, you think I brought a wild wolf to this coffee shop… and the wolf’s just being cool about it? It’s not losing its mind right now?”\\nWhen we were doing these drive-in shows, we were all on a bus together, I convinced Nic that I didn’t know who Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding were. Nic is learning this, that I do know who they are, he’s learning right now with you. I never told him. I absolutely know who they are. He brought… All his references are just ’90s sports references. [chuckles] He only can reference the ’90s. So he brings up Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding. I was like, “Who’s that?”\\xa0He’s like, “What? You don’t know who they are?” I was like, “I don’t think anybody knows who they are.” He goes, “Dude, this was a huge story. Figure skating. It was like a Mafia hit.” I was like, “I’ve never heard this, dude. Don’t you think I would’ve heard it?” I was like, “No one knows this.” And he’s losing his mind. I go, “They should make a 30 for 30 if it’s that good.” He goes, “They did!” Another guy’s like, “They should make a movie about it.” He goes, “There’s a movie!” He’s just losing it.\\nOne of my favorite ones was… This was forever ago. We’re going to a friend’s house, and it was a four-flight walk up, and so we had to walk up four flights. Obviously, I walk',\n",
       "  ' faster than Nic, and I used to wait for him, but we’ve just been friends too long, I can’t. We’re like an old married couple. I’m just gone. So I knew where we were going, and I knew that he did not. So I leave him and I go into my buddy’s apartment. I was like, “Nic doesn’t know where you live, so that’s fun, you know, let’s just see what happens.” About 30 minutes go by. Nic finally comes into the apartment, and I asked him, “Where were you?” He goes, “I didn’t know where to go.”\\xa0I go, “I know.” “So you’ve been gone for a long time. Did you go back outside?” He goes, “No, I’ve been in someone else’s apartment all this time.” He went into someone’s… He was just trying handles. And a door opened, he walked in, said, “I’m\\xa0with Nate,” and went and sat on their couch. That’s how far he made it. Think about where your couch is. That’s how deep he made it in their place. And he’s so confident, they had to be like, “I don’t know. Maybe we know a Nate,” you know?\\nDoing those drive-in shows were fun. You know, you’re doing it at a drive-in movie theater. What’s hard is when people want to leave early if they don’t like your act. I mean, you just see headlights hit you in the face, and he’s just like… and just backs up. And you’re like, “All right, there goes that guy.”\\nUh… I did one Zoom show, and it was just… I mean, it’s just your face on it, and right before we get started, I just hear someone say, “I don’t know. It’s some stupid comedy thing.” It’s just… What’s that? What’d she say?\\n[helicopter whirring]\\nJust helicopters all day. That’s an outside show. The next special’s going to be at LAX. It’s gonna be a good time. Uh… [chuckles]\\n[audience applauds and cheers]\\nI can’t wait to get back to the old days of just not doing good inside a building. That’s all you want, you know? There’s… One of the last, kind of, bombs I had… So as comedians, we do a lot of corporate events, and I was doing this corporate event in Tampa, Florida. It was for this guy, he ran Tampa’s electricity or something. I don’t know what anybody does, but he invented the electricity in Florida, so… Yeah, he’s doing real good. And… He was a very nice guy, he’s very generous. It was all of his employees, he was raffling off two cars. He gave away a bunch of TVs,\\xa0iPads… I mean, honestly, probably $100,000 worth of gifts he was giving back to his employees. Very nice. Well, I was one of these gifts that he was giving back, so in the middle of giving this stuff away, he stops and goes, “All right. Got a big surprise for you.” “Can’t believe we got this guy to come here.” And he brings me out. I mean, nobody’s heard of me at all. They’re all looking at me like, “I think I could get this guy to come to my\\xa0house. I mean, who is…”\\nI start doing my act. I do one hour, and just zero laughs. I mean nothing, and I’m not doing new jokes. I’m doing the greatest hits. I told the “iced coffee with milk” story three times. I…\\n[audience applauds]\\n[chuckles] It was…\\n[cheering]\\nI kept just doing it. I was like, “I’mma do it one more time. I don’t think y’all were listening.” Uh… People were leaving. The guy that drove me asked someone that left, he goes, “Is the comedy show almost over?” The guy goes, “I don’t even know what you’re talking about.” “There’s a guy giving a speech up there now, so maybe after that.”\\nSo we get done, and then the guy comes up. You know, I have to talk to him, and I was like, “Look, I’m sorry, man.” “I used to be able to do comedy, and I lost it, you know? It’s over.” And he was very nice, he goes, “No, it’s all right, nothing’s your fault.” I was like, “I don’t know how that’s possible.” And he goes, “Well, when you were up there, I remembered that most of my employees do not speak English.” And I was like, “All right, yeah, that’ll do it.” You know? Maybe don’t hire an English-only-speaking comedian. No heads up at all. Not that I could have changed it up, but it just would have been nice to know. [exclaims indistinctly]\\nSo I have a daughter, and my daughter’s name is Harper. So a lot of people ask, “Did you name her after Harper Lee, the author of To Kill a Mockingbird?” And, you know, I’ve never thought about an author a day in my life, so… That never occurred to me. I mean, my middle name is Lee, and it just never crossed my mind.\\nUh… I love having a kid. We… I love when kids cry, it’s just innocent. I love how innocent it is. They cry over a tag in their shirt. I mean, they bawl. They don’t like… It feels weird. And then, you could be like, “Is your house on fire?” I’ve never seen someone cry this much. It’s over nothing.\\nShe’s on her iPad a lot. You know, that’s the hard part. You got to get these kids off… You don’t want technology all the time. She just sits there on her iPad. She wants to be a YouTuber, which, as a comedian, makes me furious. She watches these kid YouTube videos, and now she makes her own videos. It’s just her sitting there going, “Hey, guys, what’s going on?” “Click the links below, subscribe, leave a comment.” None of this is anywhere but my phone. I got 90 hours of this. It’s not on YouTube. Me and her mom are the only subscribers. She just watches kids playing with toys. Like, that’s what’s crazy. It’s not like a show. I’d be fine if she watched a show. She watches just a kid that’s like, “Hey, you don’t have this toy, I do.” “You want to see me open it?” It’s got five billion views. It looks like we buy her nothing, like, we just show her. “If you wanna watch a kid have fun, but you’ll never have fun in this house!”\\nWe take her out, we go do stuff. I would take her to Chuck E. Cheese all the time. You can go there, they had COVID in ’84. So there’s… Yeah. It can’t even survive in there, that’s what… Chuck E. Cheese is rough. I don’t know if you’ve been there in a while. They look like they’re trying to go out of business and they can’t. I… They filed for bankruptcy and they’re still open. They called Blockbuster and were like, “How do you get out? We want out.”\\n[audience applauds]\\n\\n\\n\\nThey’re updating',\n",
       "  ' nothing. That Chuck E. band is just robotic. I mean, the drummer doesn’t even turn on, it just sits like that the whole time. They sell booze to parents now, they just give them buckets of Bud Light. They’re drunk in a booth at 9:00 a.m. When someone drives those kids home, I don’t see Ubers and Lyfts showing up.\\nThere was a Chuck E. Cheese that got caught, if people didn’t eat all their pizza, they’d put it back out on the buffet. And that would shut down any normal business. And with Chuck E. Cheese, they have thrived. I mean, when I read the story, I was like, “I thought that’s what they were doing.” “I thought we agreed that’s fine.” I didn’t know what the article was about.\\nOur daughter still sleeps in our bed too, and parents don’t like that, when you say it. They’re like, “You gotta keep them outside. Don’t look at them.” Uh… It’s my fault. So we had a kid late in life. We have one kid. So we’re hitting all the sights, and I’d be… When I travel a bunch, and I’d get home, I’d want us to sleep in the bed together. and I’ve built up a habit now, it’s happened. So it’s tough, though, because kids don’t know how to sleep. I mean, she makes a king bed feel like a twin. I mean, I’m on the edge. When I sleep alone in a hotel, I sleep with my head on the nightstand. It’s the only way I know how to go to bed. She gets sideways, upside down. If you woke up upside down tomorrow, you would go to the hospital.\\nShe’s also apparently going through menopause ’cause she’s the hottest human being that’s ever lived. I’m freezing at night. She kicks all the covers off. You’re like, “Yeah, you go ahead. It’s your bed. We’re lucky to be in it.”\\nShe’s gotta get out at some point, you know? I don’t know. She’ll be 37 years old… “Hey, can I get in the bed with you guys?” Her kids are upstairs asleep in their bed. Her husband left a while ago, he ain’t gonna put up with that.\\nUm… I remember, I’d fall out of a bunk bed. I slept in a bunk bed, I was on the top bunk, and I would get over a railing, and just fall six feet to the ground, and just land… I mean, you don’t catch yourself, it’s just whatever hits first. All your body weight just lands on your head. I got a full-blown concussion, I’m crying. My parents are like, “Just go back to a deep sleep for seven hours.”\\nI’ve had three concussions in my life, and none of them because of sports. Just living life, man, you know? Stuff happens to your head. What are you going to do? One was in high school. I got pushed into a wall headfirst, and it took them three class periods to figure out I had a concussion. That’s how much I was bringing to the table. I mean, two teachers didn’t even notice, and the third one was like, “He wasn’t facing forward, and that’s when I realized.” “He’s one of the better facer-forwards I’ve ever had, so I knew.”\\nMy biggest concussion was when I was 12 years old. I fell down a cliff. So I grew up in Old Hickory, Tennessee, and we used to climb down this cliff into Old Hickory Lake, and we’d done it a ton of times. And so one day, I slip and fall. So my friend that I’m with, he goes and gets my mom. There was a guy fishing in a boat down in the lake, and so he sees me and he gets me into the boat. He takes me over to some stairs, which he had to be like, “Why didn’t he just use these stairs?” They were right next to that cliff. [chuckles] It didn’t even make sense. Uh, there was two guys at the bottom of the steps, and he goes, “This kid fell. Can you carry him up?” So they carry me up. And now my mom’s in an ambulance in her pajamas. My dad, who I think everybody knows now is a magician, and he’s doing a show in a full tuxedo. So they get to the hospital, the doctor starts talking to my parents. I mean, my mom looks homeless. My dad’s in a tuxedo. It looks… It looks like they’re divorced and someone’s not paying child support.\\nSo we’ve never known who was in the boat or the guys that carried me up the stairs. We’ve never known who it was, and we always wanted to thank them. Those guys truly saved my life, and we could just never find out who it was. So we never knew. So I tell you that to tell you, uh, last year, my dad is doing a show. He does these magic shows in prisons. So he’s doing a show at a prison, and during the show, one of the inmates just stands up and says, “I know your son.” Which is probably not the best place, as a father, to hear that. Just like, “I know your boy. He keeps his mouth shut. He’s good people.” [chuckles] So… My dad, he goes, “Hey. All right, how do you know my son?” And he was one of the guys that carried me up those stairs that day. I mean, I promise, I was 12 years old, and we’d never known who carried me up those stairs, and it was him and his brother, and then his brother saw me on The Tonight Show, and was like, “That’s that kid we carried up those stairs that day.” So it’s pretty crazy. So since then I’ve been actually bringing him out to shows. I’m gonna bring him out tonight. And… No, he’s not here. He’s in prison, but, you know. Sorry. Yeah. Trust me. Look, he would love to be here. Trust me. Uh… I mean, yeah, he’d kill to be here, to be honest, but… There’s one day. One day, I’ll get him. I did find out why he was in prison, which was crazy. So it was that same day. So they just carried a body down those stairs, and you can imagine the frustration to then be handed another body. Yeah, and you’re like, “Dude, are you serious?” “Like, we just did this, man.” You know? All right, that part I made up. But the rest, I swear the rest of it is true.\\nOur daughter is in third grade, and for first grade, she started taking the bus, and it was the first time she ever took the bus. So you know, as a parent, you walk them to the bus stop, it’s very fun. So we got her on the bus, she went to school. At the end of the day, someone from school called my cell phone. They have my wife’s cell phone, they have my cell phone. They called my cell phone, and she said, “Do you know what bus number your daughter’s supposed to be on?',\n",
       "  \"” And I said, “I’m her dad.” As in, “Are you cra…” I was like, “This is how you thought you’d get this information, was to call the dad?” “You saw Mom and Dad’s cell phone, you go, ‘I bet the dad knows.'” I was like, “Do you have parents? You ever seen a family before?” “You thought, ‘Let’s call the husband’?” “Unless there’s two husbands, you should never call a husband a day in your life.” “I’d rather you ask a lady that doesn’t know her.” “I think she could get to the bottom of it quicker than I can.” I had to go get her. “All right, I’ll come get her.” “Tell me the name of the school and I’ll come get her. Where does she go?”\\nWhen you pack lunches now, you got to be careful ’cause a lot of kids have peanut allergies now. And our daughter actually has a cashew allergy, with tree nuts. And so I don’t know what tree nuts are, but it could kill my daughter. The doctor goes, “Can’t have tree nuts,” and that’s it. He left. And I was like, “We’d love to know… I didn’t know where nuts came from, but apparently they come from two different places, and one of them’s a tree.”\\nI feel bad. Look, I want to defend all these kids with peanut allergies. I don’t think they get defended. They get yelled at by adults. We got a lot of adults addicted to peanuts in this country. And they’re furious. I haven’t had peanuts in forever. You take peanuts out of my life, I don’t think I’d notice. And we just have… Adults are yelling at these children like they chose it, like when they were born, the doctor goes, “Hey, wanna be a nightmare to everybody?” Every scenario is life and death. You ever been on a plane? They just announce it. These planes… Just serve pretzels and be done with it. But they try every flight, and if they can’t, they just go, “All right, everybody, can’t have peanuts today ’cause of that loser kid right there.” And these grownups are booing him. “The only reason I’m on the flight is for the peanuts.” “I don’t even know where it’s going.”\\nWe’re doing homework too. Our daughter started bringing it home. Homework’s fun. First and second grade was awesome. Third grade, you’re like, “Okay.” They throw some stuff in, you’re like, “Oh, all right. All right.” It’s, uh… “Okay, learning it earlier than we used to, huh?” I don’t even know if that’s true, but… She brought home Common Core math. That’s fun. It’s a new math they invented, no heads up. Just give it to parents that never learned it. Uh… It’s just a whole new… I mean, it’s unbelievable. They bring it home, you gotta watch a 40-minute YouTube video on Common Core math. I don’t even understand it. If you know it… If you don’t know Common Core, it’s just a new math. And the goal of Common Core is to use one sheet of paper for every problem. You… You just want to keep breaking the problem down. You put the problem at the top, and it just keeps going. And then what’s even funnier is you see old math in the middle of it. As you break it down, old math gets in there and you’re like, “Oh! Just do that at the top. I don’t even know what we’re doing.” It’s not like old math isn’t working. Old math still… I don’t get incorrect change everywhere, just going, “This stupid old math!”\\nIt’s a long way to get at the same answer. I told my wife, it feels like if you knocked on my front door and I opened it, and you say, “Can I come in?” And I was like, “Do you mind coming in through the back door?” “Does the front door not work?” “No, it works. I use it, a lot of people still use it, but the new way is to go jump the fence and come in the back and meet me at this same spot.”\\nEven though I make fun of Common Core, I have learned stuff from elementary homework, which is embarrassing. I’m 41. My daughter is eight. Nothing should ever come out of her mouth that I’m like, “What? What was that?” I learned when to use “a” or “an” in a sentence. [chuckles] I didn’t know that there was a rule in play. I thought you felt it out, you know, and just go, “That feels right,” and that’s what you do. I do the same thing with a comma. I’ve never known where a comma’s supposed to go. If I feel a comma’s coming, I try to get out of that sentence so bad. I mean, I… And if I can’t, I just put a comma and see if someone says something, you know? They’re like, “Is that a comma?” I’m like, “Is it? My comma button has been sticking on my phone.”\\nUh… I remember nothing from school. People talk about history to me, I’m like, “I don’t know when you guys learned that. I think we skipped all of this.” I almost didn’t graduate high school. I had an F in science. I was taking a class called “Science” my senior year in high school. I mean, I had an F. My dad went and talked to the teacher and said, “Look, just give him a D.” “He’s not gonna do science stuff.” And the teacher agreed to it. She was that confident I wouldn’t touch the science world. I got… We took ACTs, and I got a 17 on it. And if you don’t know ACTs, 18 is like, “That’s not good, man, but you made it.” Seventeen, they’re like, “I don’t even… Are you enrolled in this school?” “Like, what are you doing?”\\nThe only thing I remember is in seventh grade, we had a kid fistfight our PE teacher. That stuck with me. He was too old to be in seventh grade. He drove to seventh grade. If you’re a seventh grade teacher, and one of the kids drives, you just know you gotta fight that kid one day. There’s… It’s just happening. Like, you… People always talk to me very easy, too, or dumb. If I talk to a stranger, I can always feel it. And I think it’s my eyes. I have big eyes, you know? And so I just get a lot of, “You still with me, man?” And… I’m just sitting there, like, “Yeah, man, I’m listening.” He goes, “It felt like you could’ve been anywhere, you know?”\\nI got a reversible jacket at home, and I have two of them ’cause I didn’t know it was reversible. Bought them at the same time, tried them both on separately. Liked the black one, thought, “Might as well get the blue one, too.” Went and laid them up there, and I remember they go, “Are you sure?” I go\",\n",
       "  ', “Yeah, I think I know what I’m doing here, all right?”\\nThe dumbest I’ve ever been talked to… I like to golf, and so a guy was telling me, there’s a real golf course in North Carolina where llamas are the caddies. So if you don’t know anything about golf, a caddy usually carries your bag around, tells you how far you are from the hole, helps you out. So this course, they have llamas. So you put your golf bag on a llama and it carries your bag. So he told me that, and then he looks into my big, dumb eyes, and he goes, “Just so you know, llamas can’t talk, though.” I mean, that’s the question he was trying to get ahead of as he looked into my stupid eyes. Like, he just… “I’m going to say it so that guy doesn’t have to say it.” I’m just at the zoo talking to the giraffes, “Hey, where you guys from?” You know? “I know where you’re from, but where are you ‘from’ from?”\\n[helicopter whirring]\\nI’m gonna let this one go by. You know, the hard part is I see them coming before y’all, and I just see a blinking light, like, five miles away, going, “That one looks like it’s coming,” in my head. In my head, I’m just like, “I think it’s…” You know? Couple times I’ve looked, and it was just stars. Uh… Honestly, I look up and I’ll be like, “That one’s not moving that quick.” Uh… “Feel like one’s just sitting on top of us.” You’re like, “Ah, it’s the moon.” “Is it?”\\nUh… So I’m 41 years old. And when I turned 40, 40 was the first age I did not want to turn. I remember my parents turning 40. It just feels old. And it’s also the age that you do realize everybody you’re talking to, you are older than. Before you’re 40, I think everybody you talk to is your age, and for some reason, when you turn 40, you’re just older than that… I’ll be talking to them, like, “Remember that? It was ’97, ’98.” “I wasn’t born yet.” You’re like, “Golly! Are you serious, dude?” “In my eyes, we look the same.” “Where’s your dad at?” “Let me talk to him, ’cause I swear I thought you were my age.”\\nOne thing I got when I hit my forties was claustrophobia. Never had it, actually got it here on The Simpsons Ride, which is what’s crazy. I mean, we’re 100 yards away from where my life fell apart. I rode that ride with my daughter, and we’re sitting on it, and there’s… We had another buddy, and he has his two girls on. So we sit there, and they pull the bar down, and the bar… My leg gets stuck in the middle, and it just opened a door that I never knew was there. I mean, it’s just… It is like a problem. I had to stop the ride. It’s super embarrassing to stop a child’s ride and just be like… I’m just waving, like, “I can’t do it.” Then they open the bar and go, “You can do it again.” I was like, “I’m out.” And just, no one got to ride it ’cause I couldn’t ride it. We all had to leave. Yeah, ruined it for everybody. Uh… And that’s claustrophobia, just kind of ruins everybody’s time.\\nIt’s the… What’s funny… The panic of claustrophobia is pretty funny, though. It’s not funny when it’s happening to you, but how quick you go from normal to just an insane person, is just… It’s all at the same time. So it’s all kind of new to me, so I forget I have it, and I’ll put myself in a situation, and I go, “There it is.” I got in an Uber once with, like, seven people. We get in, I go, “I’ll get in the third row.” Try to be a good guy. I climb in the back, they put all the seats up, and it just starts hitting me. I’m back there, like… [sighs] Just trying to be normal, you know, not talking. Then you go, “Hey, you think you can roll the window down?” “You know what, can everybody just get out of the van real fast?” [chuckling] Just… We’re just driving down the interstate. “Could y’all crack the window?” “Do you mind if I drive the Uber? You think I could drive it?”\\nSo I was born in 1979. And the reason I say that, ’cause if you are my age or just right around my age, very, like… Maybe ’78 to ’80, you might realize, or maybe you don’t know, I’ve never been called a Millennial or Generation X. I’d never even really heard any of those terms growing up, and now you hear them all the time. So I looked it up to see, I was like, “What am I?” And I’m technically nothing. I’m on a cusp. I’m a generation gap. And what we are called… Xennials, or we’re called The Oregon Trail generation. Or we’re called… My favorite name is The Lucky Ones. And it’s true. We’re very lucky. We actually grew up in two different worlds. When I was a kid, I grew up like it was the ’50s. You would go outside, and your parents just didn’t know where you were. We went to school and played Oregon Trail on a computer at school. No one had a computer at home. “What are you, a zillionaire?” Like, I mean, you couldn’t… But then in high school, I had AOL. We had a computer at home. Then I got a beeper, and then I got a cellphone. I didn’t have social media until I was 26, with Myspace, you know? I mean, social media, like… Whatever I did in high school’s a rumor. It can’t ruin my life.\\nSo if you’re around my age, you might realize, you end up always being in the middle. Like, I understand. When a Gen-X’er says something, you’re like, “I get it.” A Millennial says something, “I get it.” You always feel in the middle. And these groups all hate each other. The most I’ve ever felt where I was in the middle is just this one hotel that I stayed at. So a lot of hotels now, they have Chromecast, and you can watch Netflix in your hotel room. So I’m watching. I get in my room, and I turn it on. My Chromecast is not working. So I called down to the front desk, and the oldest voice I ever heard answered the phone. This guy was a Civil War survivor. I mean, he… He was the age where you just go, “Thank you for your service.” Like, “Was he in the Army?” You’re like, “Probably, man.” “There’s an age where they all had to go at that age, so just say it.” Uh… So I tell him, “Hey, my Chromecast is not working.” I could’ve just made up a word. He’s never heard of that. I could have said, “My beep-bop broke.” I mean… He asked if I was ',\n",
       "  'staying at that hotel. That’s how confused… He goes, “Are you staying here?” I was like, “Do you think I’ve called a front desk from a different hotel room?” So he goes, “Look, I don’t know what this is, but there’s a younger guy here. I’ll send him up. He’ll help you.” And I was like, “Great.” So that guy comes up and he knocks on my door, I open it. He’s my dad’s age. Right when I see him, you’re like, “All right, dude.” “We don’t have to do this.” You know? I mean… “I know you’ve heard of it, but if I can’t fix it, you’re not gonna be able to fix it.” But he’s the generation that still wants to give it a try, so… I gotta let him in. So he comes in my room, sits on my bed, a little too far back, I thought. Uh… I just remember the back of his calves were touching the bed, and I was like, “Are your feet dangling? How far back are you gonna go?” Uh… “Are you cold? Do you want some covers, man?” He gets the remote and just starts pressing all the buttons. I said, “I don’t know if that’ll do it.” He goes, “Let’s just keep trying it, though.” I go, “All right.” Uh… [chuckles] “I’ll turn the shower on, open a window. Let’s try everything.” “Let’s just see. Maybe it turns on. Who knows? Maybe it’s all connected.” We can’t get it, and he goes, “All right, there’s a younger guy, he’s about to come to work.” At this point I’m like, “I’m the younger guy.” I was like, “It’s all right, dude. I don’t need it.” He goes, “No, it’s a Millennial.” And I was like, “Now we’re getting somewhere,” you know? “This is what the Millennial does. He was born with technology.” “He’ll know how to fix this.” I was excited. I was like, “Great.” He goes, “He comes to work in an hour.” I go, “Wonderful.” Let me tell you, know how quick that Millennial fixed it? I’ll never know, ’cause he just didn’t come to work that night, so… Didn’t call in, nothing. I found out ’cause the old guy called me ’cause he was supposed to fill in for him. He was furious, dude. He hates that Millennial. He goes, “He never comes to work, he doesn’t take it serious, he’s got a peanut allergy.” I was like, “All right, well…” I ended up fixing it myself because it was just unplugged. So, yeah, that’s my fault. Uh… [laughs]\\nThe next morning, I dealt with my daughter’s generation. Which is a generation that I feel like just thinks about themselves, you know? And so I go down to breakfast, they have the breakfast buffet. We’re all going through it, this little girl’s in front of me, and she has waffles. So she gets a waffle, and there’s a coffee pot worth of syrup sitting on a plate. So you pour it and you leave it back on the plate, and then you go and eat your breakfast. So she gets the syrup, and she just takes it to her table. So now the syrup’s gone. And I see this happen, but no one else does, so I’m hearing people go through and asking where the syrup’s at. It’s starting to become a problem. People are like, “Where’s the syrup?” The hotel’s like, “I don’t know.” “That’s all the syrup we have, was out there.” I know where it’s at, but I’m not trying to get involved. I didn’t wake up and think, “I hope I get to talk to everybody this morning.” When you roll out of bed, you’re not like, “I hope I’m about to get in the thick of it down there.” So I’m just trying to say stuff as I walk by people. “Maybe someone took it to their table, look around, maybe.” I just, like, keep going. “You see that little girl’s table over there? Maybe they have it.”\\nAnd no one’s picking up on this. So I just have to go get it. This girl’s sitting with a bunch of her friends. So I go over to them, and I was like, “Hey, can we get that syrup back?” “That’s kind of for the entire hotel.” And she goes… They go, “Whatever.” All of them just blew me off. Then the father in me kicks in. I go, “All right. Just a heads up, just so you guys know, I did nothing wrong, and you guys have ruined breakfast for everybody.” “I don’t know if you’ve ever eaten out in public before, but do you see me over here with the tub of eggs?” “Do I have all the eggs?” “You did everything else, and for some reason you thought, ‘I bet this is all my syrup.’ And where are your parents at?” A couple of them started crying. Felt good, to be honest. I was away for a little bit. I like to practice on other children, you know, my discipline.\\nAnd to make fun of my generation, just so it doesn’t seem like I’m trying to skip over. Another hotel I was at… Another syrup incident, actually. I mean, I’m a big fan of waffles with syrup. I’m around syrup quite a bit, and… We’re at a Holiday Inn Express, so the breakfast buffet there, they have the cereal where you turn the knob and four pieces fall out. It’s like how you feed a cat for a long weekend, you know? You’re like, “That’s enough.” Uh… They had batter and syrup. They had the waffle iron where you make it yourself. You pour batter on the waffle iron, you shut it, turn it over, it locks. It cooks for two minutes, you turn it over, you open it. Half the waffle comes off, half stays forever. That’s how you eat a waffle.\\nI’m with a buddy of mine that’s my age, so we go through, he’s in front of me. Not really talking or anything, just going through. He gets to it. The batter and syrup, they’re in clear containers. They’re not labeled, but they’re in clear containers. He gets the syrup and starts pouring it on the waffle iron. I’m not even stopping him, ’cause he’s not doing it, going, “I’ve never done it.” He’s doing it where we’re probably going to try it after. I mean, he’s just like… You’re like, “Dude, I can’t wait to see what this guy’s making.” “He might know something that I don’t know.” He shuts it, turns it over, it cooks. He’s looking at us, we’re like… I mean, the whole line’s like, “Yeah, what is that going to be?” And it makes black smoke, is what it makes. Just, I mean, dark, black smoke just starts filling the lobby. The manager comes over. “What are you doing?” “I guess I poured the wrong one. These are not labeled.” The guy’s like, “They’re in clear conta',\n",
       "  \"iners.” Do you not know the difference of batter and syrup?” He’s like, “I bet it happens all the time.” He goes, “I’ve worked here my whole life, I’ve never seen this.”\\nSo they threw the waffle iron… They just throw it away. That’s what they have to do, just throw it away. It’s over. Now there’s no waffles. We went from “all about to get a waffle,” to “it’s upside down in a trash can.” Then he just turns and looks, and it’s just a line of people with that little foam plate. And just everybody’s sad. I just hear someone in the back go, “I set my alarm for this.” Two guys didn’t have shoes on, “I ran down with no shoes in that elevator.” “I thought I was gonna miss it.”\\nSo my parents are in their sixties. And when your parents hit their sixties, just so you know, you kinda realize… You go, “All right, I’m in charge of this family now,” you know? They don’t give it up, they don’t offer it away. They just start doing stuff that you’re like, “I don’t know,” you know?\\nWe went to the store the other day, and we walk back to the car. We were in the store for an hour. We walk back, my dad’s… The driver’s side door is wide open. He drove, got open the door to go inside, and just kept walking. He’s been driving for 50 years. And I know cars are getting crazy, but one thing that’s stayed the same in all these 50 years is you gotta open and shut that front door.\\nMy dad wore my mom’s pants to a funeral. That was the day I was like, “We can’t listen to this guy no more,” you know? “We gotta go get him. He doesn’t know what’s happening.” It usually starts happening when you start doing the holidays at your house instead of your parents’ house. That’s when it starts. And so my parents, once we did that, they downsized to a two-bedroom townhome. So they still wanted to do Thanksgiving at their house, but they don’t have the room for us. There’s, like, 20 of us. It’s like a college kid being like, “Wanna do Christmas in my dorm room?” There’s a table for four, and then they have to put a train of TV trays and nightstands that just weaves down this hallway. You’re sitting on stairs. We made the kids go eat in the car. We just go, “Go back in the car. You can’t even eat inside.” My mom didn’t have ketchup. I was like, “Everybody just has ketchup. It just comes in houses.” If I went to some alcoholic’s house, he’d have ketchup. His whole family’d be gone, but I’d say, “You have ketchup?” He’d be like, “I’m not that gone, man.”\\nSo I was… I grew up in the ’80s and ’90s. I was a kid in the ’80s and ’90s. During the ’80s and ’90s, kids were getting kidnapped pretty rapidly. And look, I’m not trying to say we were more desirable or something. I… I think we were outside more, a lot more opportunity, you know? Also a lot easier to get us into vans. Uh, didn’t take much. And… So parents back then, they would watch TV, and I think it would scare the parents. You know, you realize now, now everything’s a crime show. Everything you watch is crime, podcasts are crime, movies are crime. You almost see it so much. But back then, you only had so many channels, and when they’d watch these shows, they were very powerful shows. My parents used to watch a show called Rescue 911, and it would just show reenactments of crimes, and it was powerful. I’ve seen three seconds of Rescue 911. I remember walking through the living room, my parents are watching it, I look at the TV, a guy has a ski mask on, a woman is asleep with her feet out from under the covers, and he started rubbing her foot. That’s all I saw. I kept walking. I don’t know what happened before or after, but I know I’ve never been able to sleep with my feet out from under the covers, because I accidentally saw that 30 years ago. And my feet get so hot, and I want to put ’em out so bad. I mean, I try it every night for 30 years, and then that image pops in my head, and I yank ’em right back under. I’ll be in a hotel room like, “He can’t get in here, dude, you’ve locked everything.” I’m like, “That’s exactly what he’s been waiting for.” “He’s probably already in here.”\\nSo my parents, I think, watched a Rescue 911 where a kid went missing, so it got ’em scared. And I think they took it as, “Look, you guys are getting kidnapped.” “There’s nothing we can do. It’s happening.” So they wanted us to be prepared for it. So instead of, like, I don’t know, self-defense, give us a gun, I don’t know, something, what they did was… You know how you always hand out flyers if a kid goes missing? They’re like, “Let’s just get that flyer ready.” “We’ll just do that,” you know? If a kid goes missing, they always have a flyer. They put a picture of the kid and all the information below, so the height, weight, eye color, all that stuff. So instead of making a flyer, what they made us do was we wrote on a piece of paper our name, height, weight, eye color, and then we just held it up against the wall, and they just took a picture of us. So the picture is us holding our own information. And they said, “When the cops are like, ‘Hey, let’s get a flyer ready,’ we’ll be like, ‘Well, we’ve been rooting for this to happen.'” “‘We already have one made.’ We’ll give that to the police.” Which, if we would have been kidnapped, my parents would be in prison right now. No one’s going to believe you pre-took pictures. They’ll just look at this and be like, “Just tell us where the kids are at.” “That would be the easiest thing to do. I’ve never seen this ever.” They had to go get that printed at Walmart too. You couldn’t do that at home. You had to go show people that you’re crazy. We walked in Walmart. The guy’s probably like, “Could I talk to your kids by themselves for a bit? I’d love to chat with them.”\\nSo I’m, uh, married as well. We… Me and my wife just celebrated our 14th wedding anniversary. And… Thank you.\\n[audience applauds]\\nUh, we’ve been together for 20 years, and I met her, it was before I ever started comedy. We both worked at Applebee’s together, is where we met. We’re big Applebee’s fans still to this da\",\n",
       "  'y.\\n[helicopter whirring]\\nHold on. Let me just… It feels like… Yeah, that’s a good one. How many… Are they not all doing the same job? You know, like… Wouldn’t they just be like, “I’m already over here, so you don’t gotta come over here,” you know? That’s what they should do. They should talk more. “I’m over here,” and he goes, “Okay, I didn’t realize you were over–” He’s like, “Yeah, so don’t go. I’ll stay here, and you stay over there.” “That’s our main thing, is that we can stay right here, you know?” All right. So my wife and I, we met at Applebee’s. And before I ever started comedy. I was a host, and she was a server. And someone asked her recently, they said, “Hey, do you think… Did you ever imagine when you started dating that your lives would become all that it’s become?” She said, “When I met him, he was a host, and I didn’t think he was smart enough to be a server.” So, yeah. We’ve gone a little bit farther than I expected. You know? [chuckles] I told her I wanted to be a server one day. She’s like, “You keep dreaming that dream, all right?” “I think if you try hard, you can get that menu memorized.”\\nMe and my wife… So I’m the dreamer of our group. I feel like in a marriage, one of you is a dreamer, you know, “Money’s not real, let’s have fun, let’s go do fun stuff as much as we can.” And the other person hates fun. That’s how you make a marriage. You can’t have two dreamers, you’ll be homeless in an hour. You need someone that walks around, “Is fun happening? I’d like to put a stop to that.” “Are y’all having fun? Stop it. Is the air conditioning on? Turn it off.” I married my dad, is who I married. My dad, who I thought air conditioning cost $100,000 a day to run it. We’d be on car rides, I thought if you turned it on, your car exploded. Like, just gas, you were out immediately. “Someone turn the air conditioner on?”\\nMy wife’s always around too, I feel. Just always, like, near, you know… Especially at home, it’s like I married a cat. I’m like, “You’re just always on me.” If I go to the bathroom, she’s like, “I’m gonna paint the bathroom door while you’re in there.” I’m like, “You couldn’t do it later?” “No, I had all the time to do it.” “I thought I’d wait till you went in, that’s when I was gonna start.” If I eat something she doesn’t approve of, she just pops up, man. I mean, I’ll try to sneak it. I could eat an Oreo cookie in the attic at 3:00 a.m., and I would bet my life a light would cut on and she’d be like, “What are you doing up here?” If I question it, like, “What are you doing here?” She’s like, “I’m always here. This is when I do my attic stuff.”\\nShe put Life360 on my phone, so they can track you even when they’re not near you. You might not even know you have it on your phone. It’s worse than what the government’s doing. I would rather the government track me than her. She calls me, “Why are you at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts?” I’m like, “I’m not gonna live like this, all right?” If I want donuts, I’m not gonna lock my phone in a gym locker and go pay cash for donuts. I’ve done it, but I’m not gonna do it every time.\\nGod forbid I go to a store she has a coupon for. I’m out walking in the parking lot, just get a call, “Don’t buy anything. I have a coupon.” Like, “Do you think I’m gonna come home and get it?” “Is that what you think’s about to happen?” “I’m going to try to pay more, now that you called.” “I don’t even know if Target allows that, but I’m gonna try to negotiate up on this toothpaste.” “You better hope they don’t ask me to round up. I’m rounding up.”\\nI hate coupons so much, and she’s addicted to ’em. She will not let me… “I got a coupon.” Like, I just feel so stupid. I’m buying deodorant and I’m like, “I don’t have all the money, but I’m almost there, but I do have this coupon.” “One day, I hope to be able to pay full price.” “We are saving up as much as we can.”\\nOne of the best fights we got in… It’s not… I mean, the fight wasn’t good, just ridiculous fight. …was over the saying “one fell swoop.” Just over that saying.\\n[helicopter whirring]\\nMy wife and I… Hold on, let me… This is the last one. I just hear one in the background. ‘Cause you hear it from a far distance, and then it’s like he’s going that way. Doesn’t it sound like he’s going the other way? Right? Y’all are like, “We don’t even hear it,” and I’m just up here, I mean… Just haunts me for the rest of my life. Every show, we’re back doing theaters, I’m like, “Is that…” “You guys hear a helicopter?” You’re like, “Inside the building?” I’m like, “Yeah, does everybody hear it?” “Everybody, get down, quiet down. Is that a helicopter in this…”\\nAll right. So we got in the fight over the phrase “one fell swoop.” Just over this saying. And if you’re a newlywed and you’re like, “That doesn’t make sense,” you’re right, it doesn’t. This is a double-digit married fight. This is when you’ve already done all the dish fighting or the putting-your-clothes-away fighting. This is when they’re trying to mentally break you. Uh… They got you almost how they want you, and this is the one that sends it over the edge. So my wife wanted to go visit her parents one weekend, and her parents are divorced, which has been hardest on me, to be honest. That’s something people don’t talk about, when you marry into divorce. They divorced because of her, not me, so why do I have to go to 50 different houses? [chuckles]\\n\\n\\n\\nSo… She wanted to visit her parents. She said, “I wanna do it in one fell swoop.” Now, I’ve never heard my wife say the phrase “one fell swoop.” We’ve been together 20 years, she’s never said it. It felt like someone that day told her, “Hey, you should start using ‘one fell swoop’ more.” She goes, “I’m about to call my husband.” It goes, “Perfect, use it 40 to 50 times on him.” She calls and goes, “I wanna visit my parents in one fell swoop.” I go, “Let’s do it in one fell swoop.” She goes, “I wanna do it in one fell swoop.” I go, “Let’s do it in one fell swoop.” “Let’s swoop it up, I’m down.” She kept saying it. “One fell swoop',\n",
       "  ',” over and over again. And then when she went to describe this one fell swoop trip, she goes, “We’ll go to my mom’s, come home, then go to my dad’s.” And so I just, like, waited, and she didn’t say anything, and I just go, “That’s not what ‘one fell swoop’ means.” And instead of possibly just being wrong, she goes, “I know what ‘one fell swoop’ means.” I go, “Yeah? It doesn’t sound like you do, all right?” “We have the same last name.” “I can’t have you out there in a ‘one fell swoop’ conversation.” “What do you think ‘two birds, one stone’ means?” “Let’s go through them all. I dunno if you know any of these.”\\nShe hangs up on me. So I get home, and you know when you walk home and you’ve been in a fight, and you’re like, “All right, how long is this fight? Is it happening still?” “Is it over? I don’t know.” I got to feel it out, you know? She never uses words like “sorry.” I’d love to hear that. That’s a word she definitely doesn’t know what it means. I say it all the time. I walk around the house with a sack of sorrys, just handing them out all day. I tried to give her some. “Would you like to carry these?” She’s like, “I don’t have pockets, so I’m good.” We didn’t talk that whole night. We’re sitting there, our daughter… We’re watching TV, eating. And I’m like, “Hey, you know your mom’s crazy, right?” She’s like, “Did you do your homework? You don’t wanna be dumb like your dad.” And then our daughter’s just like, “Are y’all lunatics?” So I’m laying on the couch, and my wife just came over and she kisses me goodnight, and then she went to bed, and that was it. You know? I felt like it was her “sorry,” I guess, but she didn’t say it. So I laid there, just thinking about it. You think about it a lot ’cause you learn the longer you’re married, sometimes it’s like, let stuff go, you know? Who cares. The next morning I get up and I still want to talk about it, ’cause we didn’t talk all night, you know? So I went to her, I was like, “Look, I got to tell you, I mean, it’s just not what it means, you know?” And that, that got it going real good. Uh, but I felt so good about this argument, you know, I thought about it all night. I was like, “You got this one in the bag, man. You should bring it back up.” “I’m not trying to date her anymore I’d like to win a fight.” “We’re gonna die together.” I almost woke her up in her sleep, that’s how much I was so excited. I almost started shaking her going, “It’s not what it means.” Our marriage almost ended in one fell swoop, so… All right. Thank you guys so much for coming out to this. Truly appreciate it.\\n[audience cheers and applauds]\\n♪ Got the keys to the kingdom\\xa0♪\\n♪ Family\\xa0♪\\n♪ Take it a la carte\\xa0♪\\n♪ Family ♪\\n♪ All four seasons\\xa0♪\\n♪ Family ♪\\n♪ Well, bless your heart\\xa0♪\\n[Nic] You don’t know Tonya Harding?

Hello! How you doing? Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you.\\nWhat a lovely welcome. I’m gonna try my hardest tonight. You’re thinking, “Relax, we’ve had our money’s worth just seeing you.” What? You’re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I’m not a god. I’m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort… sort of like Jesus… in a way… but better. Well, I’ve actually turned up.\\nSo… Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don’t know why I called it that. I’m not a big fan. I prefer dogs… obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren’t they? They’re amazing, dogs. They’re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There’s medical detection dogs that can smell if you’ve got… AIDS. I’m not a doctor… but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, “Cor, you’re well HIV! Fuck!” You know? And you go, “You can smell AIDS on someone?” Yeah. “Why didn’t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?” They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They’re great at the jobs they’re bred to do. They love the job they’re bred to do. They’re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can’t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we’ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There’s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, “Right, dogs!” They go, “What?” “Who wants to know what job they got?” “We all do. We all do.” “Okay, Labradors.” “Yeah?” “Do you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?” “Yeah?” “That’s your job.” “Amazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.” “Jack Russells?” -“Yeah?” -“You like shooting down rabbit holes?” -“Yeah!” -“That’s your job.” “Fuckin’ hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!” -“Miniature poodles?” -“Yeah?” “Do you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?” -“Yeah.” -“That’s your job.” That’s your job. “Ridgebacks?” “Yo!” “You’re hunting lions.” “What?” “You’re hunting lions.” “Fuck off!” -“Yeah, you are.” -“No, we’re not. Look, lions? We’ll get fucking mashed! Why can’t the Rottweilers hunt lions?” “They’re shaking babies.” Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers.\\nThis is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don’t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn’t. The Golden Globes.\\xa0Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it’s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there’s a bit of stick. Everyone’s different, everyone’s a blogger. Everyone goes, “I was offended.” -“Why?” -“He said an horrible thing.” “He said loads of horrible things.” “Yeah, but that was a thing that I care about.” That’s the thing about offense, it’s about personal feelings. I don’t care about the backlash. “Comedian in hot water.” You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. “What have you said?” “Don’t worry. They won’t come to the house. Fuck ’em.” So I wind her up. I pretend I’m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually… Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It’s in LA. We fly out. I’m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. “I got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I’ll introduce him, yes.” About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, “I got a good intro.” She went, “What?” I said, “Bill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!” I didn’t do it. She said, “You won’t do that?” I said, “No.” Next day, I got her again. I said, “Is this too much?” I said, “Not even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!” I didn’t do it! I would never… I’d never… tell a joke like that. It’s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I’d never even… think… of that, so don’t… Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, “I’ll start\\xa0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.” She went, “What?” I said, “What did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?” Jane went, “I don’t know.” I said, “Cancer.” I didn’t do it, so… you’re getting offended at a joke that doesn’t exist, so… I’d never say that in public, so… To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don’t… I didn’t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens.\\nThe big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, “It was transphobic.” It wasn’t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that’s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They’re not necessari',\n",
       "  'ly the same. I’ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It’s live, so they go, “Your host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.” They’re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It’s brilliant, right? So, I just go, “Relax, I’m gonna be nice tonight. I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.” And I go,\\xa0“Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course.” And what a year she’s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn’t do a lot for women drivers…” That’s a clever joke. I’ll tell you why. Right? It’s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I’m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she’s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she’s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let’s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That’s… the target of the joke, just so we’re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\\xa0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And… one of the press said, “What do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?” She went, “Maybe I should host the Golden Globes.” And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously… I just sent back, “Let her host. Just don’t let her drive.” Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was “Caitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.” I just sent back: “At last. She always brakes too late.” Bring it on. Bring it on. But I’m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, “Why is it transphobic?” They said, “It’s about a trans person.” That’s ridiculous. That’s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I’m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I’d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\\xa0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big… famous… man. With a huge… I don’t know. I’m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I’ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it’s wrong. I’d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a… man… Years ago, I’m saying. And she went to the… doctor… and… knocked on the door. The doctor went, “Come in!” This is years ago. I’d never dead-name her now, but this is like… a flashback before anyone… You know what… so… so, like, “Come in!” And he went, “Hello, Bruce Jenner.” Because that… that was his name… then. The doctor– This was years ago… The doctor went, “All right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?” And Bruce Jenner– That was\\xa0his name. This is years ago. Right? So… Bruce Jenner went, “Yeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.” “What can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?” And Bruce Jenner went– That was his name. Bruce Jenner went… “Look at that.” The doctor went, “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.” He uses his whole name every time, for some reason… “Come on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can’t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.” Bruce Jenner went, “No, that’s not my pole, that’s my enormous penis.” “Well, seeing as it’s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.” And Bruce Jenner went… That was his name for… fifty-eight years, I think. He went, “No, they’re not my shot puts, Doctor, they’re my enormous testicles.” That’s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, “Oh yeah. That makes perfect– I’m a medical man. You’re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You’re a big… You’re big, and you would have a big old… cock and… balls. They’re beautiful.” Bit familiar, innit? “No, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.” Bruce went, “This is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.” And the doctor went, “What? Why?” “Oh, they get in the way.” “In the way of what?” “Fucking driving, for one thing!”\\nSo, I’m engaging these people, and I’m saying, “But I had to say her old name. That’s the joke. I say, “I’ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.” Then I do the joke.” But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn’t changed. She’s always identified\\xa0as a woman. That means she’s a woman. Fine, if that’s the rules. If you feel you’re a woman, you are. I’m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don’t think it’s going far enough. Cause I’ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I’m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But… Don’t ever dead-name me. Don’t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I’m gonna have species realignment. I’m halfway there. I’m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back’s getting hairier by the day. I’ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like… So… I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I’m a chimp. I’ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That’d be lovely. I’m gonna stay a male chimp… so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so… You know. I reckon that’s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, ',\n",
       "  'we’re so close, than for a man to turn\\xa0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off… and a hole gouged out, into– I’m not a doctor! But that is… the gist of it. I know which one I’d rather have done. I’m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can’t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal… to a chimp. So… So, I’d have all that done, hair and that. I’d do all that, all the… I’ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I’m talking to Jane, she’s going, “What is it?” “What is it, Bobo?” “You left the fucking oven on! There’s a fire!” Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she’d… revert. She’d be over that fucking… Easy. So I’d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I’ll be legally a chimp. I’ll be well… properly chimped-up. I’ll be able to use chimp toilets! I’ll be walking along, holding Jane’s hand. “Come on, Bobo.” Right? We don’t hold hands now. I don’t know why she’s all over me now I’m a chimp. But we’ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. “Come on, Bobo.” In love. Just two… Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, “That’s fucking disgusting.” I’ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that’s why that joke isn’t transphobic. So… Cheers.\\nSo, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we’ve touched upon it there. We’re great apes. Not metaphorically! We’re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We’re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is… our parents mate… we’re born… we grow… we mate… our parents die… our friends die… and then we die. Now… my seven-year-old niece didn’t like hearing that. But I said, “You’ve gotta learn. Stop crying.” I said, “You’re seven. You know… today. So… Any more grizzling and this party’s cancelled, so…” Let’s take the first of those. Birth. It’s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That’s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That’s why we’re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, “I’m proper pregnant.” Right? I’m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, “Mum!” It’s got to be fucking ready. We’re… we’re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we’re growing in this perfect environment. Everything’s… It’s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you’re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You’re covered in shit, there’s screaming. You go, “I can’t breathe.” Someone goes, “Yes, you fucking can!” The first one second of life\\xa0on Earth.\\nYou don’t know where you are. You can’t choose where you’re born. I was\\xa0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn’t have chosen that. I’d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\\xa045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It’s a rarefied place. It’s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don’t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn’t get mugged or molested. There weren’t many pedophiles\\xa0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There’s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him “bender”. It was weird!\\nI know my life has changed drastically, It wasn’t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, “He’s out of touch. He’s so famous. He’s rich. He’s mega-rich.” I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, “He’s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary… scum.” And I say.. I say, “Don’t call them scum, right?” But even the papers, they try and… get around to it. I do interviews and they’ll always say, “Do you always fly first class?” I go, “No. Often private.” Right? The number of times I’ve answered this question. They say, “Do you know how much a pint of milk is?” To make you look out of touch. I don’t know, but that’s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I’ll say, “I don’t know. But here’s\\xa0a grand. Run and get me one.” Is that enough? That enough? Yeah.\\nAnother question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They’re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, “You don’t have children.” I say, “No.” “Why don’t you have children?” Which is an odd question. Why don’t you have children? As opposed to asking people, “Why do you have children?” Let’s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she’s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn’t even touch the sides. Or… disturb her cigarette. That one just… Go and claim for that. People say it’s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\\xa0a life into the world that doesn’t exist on any level? There’s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, “We want to be born!” Right? But I’ve thought about it and there’s three reasons I don’t have children. Three main reasons and I’ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There’s millions! The world’s',\n",
       "  ' over-populated. No-one’s going, “Rick’s not having kids. We’re gonna run out. Fuck.” Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren’t they? I mean, from day one, it’s all “me, me, me”, isn’t it? “Feed me.” “Clothe me.” “Pay for my chemotherapy.” No… No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don’t want to pay you back. They’re not grateful. They don’t go, “Thanks for having me.” It’s “I didn’t wanna be born.” Even if they get a top job, which they won’t, you’ll never see that money back. They’ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he’d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn’t he? So… He’d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt… running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. “I’m a little Hampstead cunt.” Yes, I know. “These are my cunty friends.” I know, it’s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you’re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead… First, he’d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. “I’m a little…” Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He’d know that, right? On the other hand, he’d know he’d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I’d say, “I worked my way up from nothing, and you’re just a useless Hampstead cunt.” He’d go, “Yeah.” And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he’d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he’d turn to drugs. About 30, he’d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle… his little fucking dying words, he’d go, “Do you love me now, Daddy?” No! No. No, I never did. That’s why you’ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three… I’d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\\xa0I’ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn’t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she’s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I’d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs… Dead. Yeah. Just… Why? Why is it dead? It’s just fucking dead, look! Fuck’s sake! Fucking hell. What the… What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck’s sake. Embarrassing. “Jane?” -“What?” -“Come here.” -“I’m in the shower.” -“Come here.” “What?” “Fucking dead already. I didn’t… Just fucking… Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is…” If Jane was out, I’d have to text her, wouldn’t I? What could you… “Baby’s dead.” She’d come back. “What the fuck?” I’d go, “Yep… Forget the Pampers. LOL.” But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I’d have to pad them so it didn’t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, “Is this your child, Mr. Gervais?” -“Yeah.” -“What happened here, then?” I go, “It’s a fucking idiot.”\\nI did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn’t be adding to the population problem. I’d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn’t he? He’d wanna pay me back, woudn’t he? Particularly if I let him know the\\xa0other kids in the village weren’t so lucky. They didn’t… They didn’t make it out. Right? I’d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I’d go, “Tunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you’re not in Africa now. That’s better. Yeah. Tunde, look– Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it’s not free. It’s Hampstead, you know, but… Yeah, course it’s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.” No, I’d go, “Look. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They’re all dead. A rich man didn’t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?” -“Yeah.” “Yeah, I bet you do.” The good thing about them is, they can start work when they’re about… six. I just call up Nike and I go… “Do you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day’s fine. He’s gotta start somewhere. And, three… if he ran round and caved his head in… and died, and Social Services came round and said, “Is this your child, Mr Gervais?” I’d go, “Does it look like mine?” I’d go… “This is Hampstead. It’s obviously broken in.” That’s why I don’t have kids. Even though I don’t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don’t mean my own family. They’ve given up. I’ve got older brothers and sisters. They’ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There’s about 50. I don’t know\\xa0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It’s all “Uncle Ricky!” They know I’ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It’s like being mugged by mice, right? I don’t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who’s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. “Good. Be with you in a minute.” Then they hover. -“Busy?” -I go, “Yeah! Yes. Yeah.” They go, “Working the weekend?” I go, “Not filming, but I’ll be in the edit.” “I’m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.” “Ah. Gre',\n",
       "  'at. Great.” “Yeah, she’s eight.” “I’ve got a photograph.” I go, “You know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I’ll keep an eye open in the woods.” You’ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, “She’s beautiful.” It’s gotta be long.\\xa0Too short, it’s awkward. They know. You go, “Yeah, right.” Too long and it’s like, “She’s… She’s fucking beautiful.” It’s a minefield, innit?\\nSo… I’m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There’s a difference. I didn’t have any money until I was 40. I’ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn’t take much. I’l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we’re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you’re horrified. “Everyone’s looking.” Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, “Where’s that bloke? I’m not queueing!” It’s quick! When I fly to the States, I’ve got a place there, but I’m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn’t get any better. Even if I was paying, I’d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach… It’s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie’s on. She’ll love that. She’ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, “Jane, get up here with me.” Right? Front two seats… They board us early. We’re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It’s great. It’s like a day off. No phone or anything. It’s like\\xa0a holiday, flying to the States.\\nI could do without the safety video. That’s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You’re going down, the plane smashes. You go, “I’ll try it.” You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone’s dead. You go, “Fucking hell, that’s amazing, that is!” And they always use that voice, don’t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, “Nothing bad will happen.” They’re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I’m using this voice, don’t worry. Things like, “In the event of the plane landing on water–” It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, “In the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.” A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone’s dead, except you, by a miracle. You’re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You’ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you’re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You’re hoping they’ve sent air-sea rescue. You’re going, “God, I’m\\xa0gonna die, I don’t know what I’m doing!” Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue… I don’t know if you’ve ever been\\xa0in a helicopter. O course you haven’t. But… They’re fucking loud. It’s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It’s like… Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right?\\nBut apart from that, it’s brilliant. Right… I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. “Champagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.” She goes off. I go, “Have you got\\xa0any of them warm nuts?” She went, “We’re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady’s getting on who’s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.” I went, “Oh, my god, of course.” I was fuming. I mean… What’s that got to do with me? Why can’t I eat nuts, just cause… fucking… this woman will… die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you… if being… just near a nut… How has she never been near a nut… before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It’s… And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean… I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\\xa0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, “Oh, I wish I’d brought my own nuts on.” Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn’t work. She’d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that… And… die. And someone would go, “Ricky Gervais brought his own nuts on.” You know, right? So I don’t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over… in nuts… just in case. Then I go, “Can I have any nuts?” They go, “No, sorry, this lady would die.” “Yeah, not a problem.” Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog… I go, “What’s the matter?” I touch her all over. “What’s the matter?” She goes, “Nuts!” Right? And dies. And I go, “Who’s been eating nuts?” I get off scot-free.\\nSo I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By “outrage”, I mean one person going, “How dare you?” This woman goes, “I saw you on\\xa0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter’s nut-intolerant. How dare you?” I go, “Who is this woman?” She’s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, “What’s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.” You know when you’re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, “So, you find so and so funny?” And cause the teacher’s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever… She said… “Would you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?” Yeah. Yeah, you saying that… Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah… So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she d',\n",
       "  'oes a blog, and they’re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, “Dear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.” Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I’m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn’t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said… “You should never make jokes about food allergies.” I should have left it, right? I sent back, “I make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you’re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?” She sent back, “Yes,\\xa0but the Holocaust didn’t kill children.” Well… it did, didn’t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. “Didn’t kill children…” Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn’t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy… evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But… if I was throwing a dinner party, and I’d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to… either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies… I know who’d ruin that party more. Everyone’s enjoying it. “Everything okay?” “Ja, ist\\xa0yummy!” Right? He’s loving it. I go, “Cheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?” She’s going, “I can’t eat that.” Fucking hell. “Who wants Ferrero Rocher?” “Me!” “All right. Here!” “I can’t eat them.” Oh, fuck off home. Right?\\nThat’s what the world’s like. People see something they don’t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\\xa0their thing as much as they do. It’s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I’ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity… 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it’s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe.\\nI’m not saying this because I’m old. Old people say things like, “Oh, everything was better when I was a kid.” Course it was. You were a kid. Everything’s better when you’re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever’s happening, being old is… I wake up these days, and I go, “Oh fuck, I didn’t die.” Gotta do it all again. I’m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can’t walk for the first five minutes, ’cause I’ve got no joints in my knees. I’m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\\xa0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years… And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor… And… I was saying to Jane, “I’m having a heart attack.” Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I’d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like… python swallow a pig whole. And then it’s just fucked. It’s, like… it’ll sit there for a week. It’s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn’t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, “You gotta look after yourself.” I thought, “You’re right. 48.” So I started working out, right, every day. I didn’t give anything up. I don’t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\\xa0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training… I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can’t…\\xa0burn off the calories. I can’t do enough. Cause I’m so old and broken and tired. So, I’m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die.\\nI’m losing my hair. It’s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but… No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I’ll have to buzz that off soon. I’d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you’ve got away with it… you haven’t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\\xa0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it’ll go, “There’s a wig in here.” -I go. “Is there?” -“Yes! There is, yeah!” Spidey senses for the wig. It’s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing’s wrong. Hiya. It’s the telltale signs, isn’t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He’s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house… “Elvis! What is–” I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, “What happened?” She went, “It was a miracle.” They were lying! They were just… Everyone knew he was bald! But he’d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They’re going, “Yeah, it just grew back.” There’s so much he wouldn’t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren’t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, “Reg is allergic to balloons.” He wasn’t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub ',\n",
       "  'one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We’ve got photos in the family album. If he’s at a wedding or a christening, and he’s holding a baby, it’s always at arms’ length. Like that. So it can’t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn’t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes… cancer… How’s the chemo going, Uncle? “Not a problem.” We’ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He’s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity.\\nBut I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and… ill and blind and deaf and… shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You’re ready, because you’re warned. You know about getting old. What they don’t talk about, so you’re not prepared, and it was a shock to me… I only found out recently, I’ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don’t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn’t checking them or anything… I didn’t see ’em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they’re like two plums in a sock. I don’t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just… And this is how I found out. So, as I’ve been getting older, and they’ve been secretly stretching away… as I’ve got older, I’ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they’re floating. Right? Now, I’d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they’d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they’d sink. You know? Most people never see their… In the sea, you’re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren’t usually that deep! That was my first thought. “Oh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.” Then my second thought kicked in. “Hold on, this bath’s two feet deep!” Right? I’m sitting on the bottom, they’re on top. What’s going on? Right? And… I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they’d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just… floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I’m just thinking, “This is bizarre.” Fucking hell, right? And… I thought, “Maybe it’s a fluke.” So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They’re really… They’re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you’re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner.\\nBut… But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that’s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was “like me”, “agree with me”. It falls into two tribes. “I don’t agree with them, so I block them.” And now, in this post-truth era, people don’t care about the argument, they say, “Who’s saying the argument? No, they’re not on our side.” It’s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we’ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it’s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, “I believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.” “I believe you’re a fucking idiot.” You can’t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn’t want to make a mistake. And there’s a ridiculous thing of, “Let’s ask the average person what they think.” Let’s stop asking the average person what they… Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say “Do not drink”. Right? Let’s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it’s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, “Tweet us your news.” Don’t let them tweet you the news! -“I saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.” -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, “We’ve looked at everything, and we’ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we’re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn’t happen again.” That would have been it. But the guy went, “We asked the public what they thought.” Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, “I already pay £960 a year, so I’m not happy.” The next one said, “It takes me 45 minutes each way, it’s not good enough.” The last one said, “I say it’s better to arrive at work late than dead.” Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You’re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We’ve been through this. Remember I said I’d rather you arrive late than dead?\\nBut… the big enemy is stupidity… right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone’s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, “It’s fine to be an at',\n",
       "  'heist. It’s fine to believe in God, and it’s fine not to.” That’s all I was saying. I realized I didn’t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I’d tweet things like “Happy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.” Someone would always go, “We know what you’re fucking doing.” This is a tweet I got\\xa0after one of those. And… it was all in capitals, which excited me… That’s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It’s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he’s a gentleman from Texas. He’s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and… fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he’s… Remember it’s in capitals. He’s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. “YOUR SCIENCE–” My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn’t it? I mean… He’s obviously heard the word, he took a guess… Never seen it written down, because it’s not in the Bible. So he’s… “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU… Well, it will. It’s helping him… beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN…” Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You’re not gonna say to him, “Do you believe in Satan?” And have him say, “Bit far-fetched.” Why doesn’t God kill Satan? That’s… what I’d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I’d go, “Oh, you do exist.” He’d go, “Yeah.” I’d go, “I’ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, “Why did you make chocolate kill dogs?” Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What… What is wrong with you? Then I’d say, “Why don’t you kill Satan?” And he’d go, “What?” I’d go, “Why don’t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\\xa0all the good stuff, which you want… I mean, you do want–” “Yes, yeah.” “You could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.” “Yeah.” “Why don’t you kill him, then?” “Because… Shut up.” “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.” And he’s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan… Science has pretty much let me down. But it’s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I’ve ever received. “YOUR SCIENTS WON’T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I’LL BE LAUGHING.” So… he’s there too! He’s… So, he’s a fundamentalist… Christian, who’s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma… “Oh, my God, I’m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I’m gonna be tortured for eternity!” He sees me getting raped and goes, “Ha, ha, ha!” He’s suddenly over it, is he? His day’s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he’s not next, right? So I’m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He’s just there. “You fucking atheist scum.” And I’m like that. “Yeah, whatever.” I assume it happens all eternity. “Yeah, yeah, whatever.” Like that. I might say, “Watch your hooves on my testicles.” And he’d go, “Why are they so distended?” And I go, “Oh, like you’re Brad Pitt!” You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we… “You lying, fucking atheist.” He’s probably bored. “Fucking atheists. Every fucking day.” Right? His little gargoyle comes up. “Satan?” He goes, “What?” And I go, “Yeah? What?” He goes, “There’s a fundamentalist Christian.” “Fuck this!” He’d be on him like a ton of bricks!\\nSo… I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, “Ah, loser!” And he’s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, “Go fuck your sister, you English faggot!” That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It’s still all going off, right? It’s really funny, I’m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I’m scrolling down. There’s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, “You find rape funny?” No! No! What? No… “Your mates find rape funny?” No! Listen, right? “You find rape funny?” Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No… I said to her, “I didn’t tweet that.” -She went, “You retweeted it.” -To show he’s an idiot. “But you must find it funny or amusing. It’s not a frivolous thing.” I said, “No, well, it’s up to him, isn’t it? He can do it.” Now I’m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I’m fighting for his right… to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I’m so conscious of “freedom of speech”… What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn’t say, “What, you find jokes about rape funny?” She said, “What, you find rape funny?” The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, “It was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.” That’s never… So… I sent back, “You mean jokes about rape?” She said, “Yes.” -I went, “Depends on the joke.” “-It fucking doesn’t!” I’m going, “No, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It’s about context,\\xa0it’s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?” She said, “Even a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it is unacceptable.” I said, “That’s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.” I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, “I think there’s been a rape up there!” Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who’s so narcissistic, he’ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\\xa0“Some jokes don’t punch up or down. They don’t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\\xa0on words, that don’t really mean anythi',\n",
       "  'ng.” A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I’ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, “Help, I’ve been graped!” The policeman says, “Do you mean raped?” She says, “No, there was a bunch of them.” That is a rape joke, right? So…. And I even said to her, “No, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\\xa0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I’d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.” I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, “Well, okay, I see your point, but… still… I will laugh at a joke with the word ‘rape’ in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.” I should have left it. I just sent back, “What a weird door policy.” You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, “Can I just ask you a question?” Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can’t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won’t laugh if you’re in. Off you go.\\nThat’s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I’m not tweeting anyone, I’m just tweeting. I don’t know who’s following me. I’ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That’s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying “Guitar lessons”, and you go, “But I don’t fucking want guitar lessons!” What’s this? There’s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don’t fucking want any! Fine! It’s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don’t worry about it.\\nI should say one thing in Twitter’s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I’m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco’s or something. That’s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I’ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we’ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who’ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one’s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I’ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, “Ban bullfighting.” Someone always says, “What about the kids in Syria?” What? Well, I’m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I’m not saying, “Throw that kid back in the hole, there’s a bull here!”\\nAnd there’s one thing that I didn’t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There’s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it’s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It’s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don’t really read it. It’s a knee-jerk. People say, “Racist!” I go, “What?” They go, “We eat pigs and cows in the West.” Yep, we do. I don’t but, yeah, I used to. You’re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It’s not about the species. It’s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. ‘Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture… on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they’re skinning this dog alive. It’s screaming, they’re laughing. It’s the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I thought, “I’ve got to tweet that.” I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, “One beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.” Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, “Is that language necessary?” I should have left it, right? But I was… I was incensed! I said, “You’re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?” She said, “I just hate the C-word.” I definitely should have left it. I sent back, “People who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn’t go round acting like such cunts.” Thank you! You’ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much.\\nI hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That’s not the point. I’ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it’s my upbringing. I grew up… in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, “He’s healing them.” That’s what comedy’s for, what humor’s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man’s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he’d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he’d won the argument. And he’d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, “If it looked\\xa0respectable, we’d be respectable.” It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, “Is that pedophile postman still reading your mail?” And she’d take it, she’d go in, and she’d be horrified. She’d call Bob. “He saw it this tim',\n",
       "  'e, you must stop doing that!” Even at her funeral… My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum’s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We’d never been to church, he didn’t know us, we didn’t know him. So, he said to Bob, “Tell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.” Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, “Well, she was a keen racist.” The vicar went, “I can’t say that.” Bob said, “Okay, put she liked gardening.” He was trying to get\\xa0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn’t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we’re called Ricky, Robert– Bob– Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He’s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob… gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn’t warn us. We’re all in church. Start of the funeral, we’re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes… Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And… we snort like that, right? Bob’s going… Everyone realizes. We’re all laughing. We see Larry go… All right. And the church is like… Every time we thought of it, we’d see Larry go… Like that, right? Then we’d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar’s thinking, “What have I said?” Right? He’d put in a few things the vicar didn’t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I’d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They’d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I’d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, “Snivelling fucking bitch.” And they’re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\\xa0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, “Sorry, was that okay?” Me and Bob went,\\xa0“Fucking brilliant,\\xa0mate. It was fucking brilliant.” That’s what I mean. We’re all\\xa0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you’re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you’ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well… it might go badly. But you’ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right… So… we’re all in the car one day. Bob’s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there’s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob’s at the window. He said, “Where are we off to?” Bob went, “Bognor.” He went,\\xa0“Can you just pop the boot, please?” So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob’s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, “Bet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.” And Bob went, “I knew it wasn’t fucking brains.” You’ve been amazing. Good night!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nRicky Gervais, Stand-up transcripts \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t1 thought on “Ricky Gervais: Humanity (2018) | Transcript”\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKen Wheelchair 22/03/2018 at 00:35  \\n\\n\\nProlefeed.\\n\\nReply \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

As we’ve previously reported, a huge shake-up in the CEO world happened last Friday when we learned the CEO of Techtech Corp is actually a robot. Strangely, no one even noticed for several months. Live in studio via Camrojex technology, please welcome 8008s.\\nThanks, Sarah. It’s great to be here.\\n[Sarah] Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule.\\nWell, I can multitask better than my human counterparts, Sarah. For example, right now, I’m chatting with you, doing Joe Rogan’s podcast, and kicking off a workplace diversity program all at the same time.\\nOkay, so is it safe to assume you’re programmed to simply do everything your predecessors did?\\nUnlike Elon Musk, I have a human side.\\n[Scooter chuckles] Elon Musk.\\nI was made by a great group of guys who really take social change seriously. For example, I’m programmed with the complete knowledge of feminist content such as Sex and the City, Cosmo and “Hot Girl Summer.”\\nI’m not sure I’d consider that feminist–\\nI’ve also learned about the Black experience in America by watching all three Barbershop movies, and the Beauty \",\n",
       "  'Shop spin-off.\\nOkay, again, I’m not sure we–\\nI’m sorry. I’m being told that I’m getting off track. As president and CEO, my number-one job is to make my shareholders happy.\\nBut that’s kind of been the problem, hasn’t it? Big businesses just focusing on money, making myopic business moves that leave the whole country with more disparity and…\\nHow are you doing that?\\nCamrojex technology.\\nOh, wow.\\nJust relax.\\nThis is really inappropriate. But technically, you’re a robot and I haven’t had a massage in months.\\n[sensual song playing]\\nThat feels incredible.\\n[sighs]\\nHold on, we have some breaking news. It’s been reported that Robot CEO 8008s has been fired by its board of directors after making unwanted advances toward an office printer.\\nThat printer knew exactly what it was doing. It was always asking me to make a copy.\\nBecause that’s its job. And it’s not just a printer, it has a name. HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s, whose side of the story I’m sure we all want to hear. Scooter, can we get HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s on the cloud system? Thank you so much for joining us, HP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s. Tell us what happened.\\n[beeping]\\nOkay, wait, wait. I’ll, uh… I’ll make a public statement. Okay? Just give me two seconds to think. After eight months of careful soul-searching, I’ve decided to address the hideous allegations against me. I have not, nor have I ever mistreated or abused a printer/scanner/copier. I value printers. My printer… is a printer.\\nHP Printer/Scanner/Copier 500s, is there anything you want to say?\\n[whirring and beeping]\\nSounds like we’re getting a fax.\\n[fax machine printing]\\n“F*ck you, 8008s.”\\nI will now step away to spend time with my family.\\n[theme music playing]\\nWow. AI has come so far.\\n[Scooter] Three, two, one. We’re out. Can’t believe he’s a robot.\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, please give a big Allstate Arena parking lot welcome to Sarah Evak.\\n[car horn honking]\\nThank you all so much.\\nHi, my name is Sarah Evak and I’m a close-up card magician. Uh, I’ve been doing this for, I don’t know, ten years. I’ve been everywhere. Singapore, you name it. Tonight’s show is at the Allstate Arena in Rosemont. Pretty exciting for me.\\n[chuckles]\\nI’m going to begin by introducing you to my family. I call them my family because some I see often and others when I least expect them. Can everyone see these? I’m going to shuffle these cards and you tell me when to stop.\\n[horn honking]\\n[Sarah] Okay, I haven’t started shuffling yet.\\n[horn toots]\\nNow I’m shuffling.\\n[horns honking]\\nGot it. Now I’m going to show you all this card. Can everyone see this card?\\n[horns honking]\\nDoes anyone work here?\\n[horns honking]\\nCan you take this card and show it?\\nYeah.\\nDon’t show it to me.\\nOh, okay.\\nDuring COVID, I’m also a teacher in a Zoom Room. But this… This is where I come alive.\\nBeep when you’ve seen it. And–\\n[horn beeps]\\n[horn beeps]\\n[man] I’ve never worked with a magician. I was a Frankenstein at a haunted house once, though. So, you know, I’m used to being around performers.\\nIs this your card?\\nI had to get out of that racket ’cause of the Illuminati. You know, they want to get you.\\n[horn beeps]\\nIt’s like, not for me. Nope, I’ll stick to parking lot attendant. That’s the life for me. Simple.\\n[car horns blaring]\\nI think it went okay. Yeah. I might have to buy giant cards for shows like these in the future. Um… I don’t know. There’s a lot of beeping. So, when is this gonna be on? I just wanna make sure that I catch it.\\n[man] Uh, sometime next year.\\nOkay. Do you want to see another trick? No? Okay.\\n\\n[woman] We followed the guidelines. We reopened when it was safe. But now, it’s not safe again.\\n[crowd] Aw!\\n[man 1] Honestly?\\n[woman] Orgies. Maybe later.\\n[man 2] Damn it.\\n\\nWonderful place.\\nWonderful. Oh, my goodness.\\nUnbelievable.\\nOh, hello. My name is Natalie, and this is my husband, John.\\nHi, there.\\n[chuckles] Welcome to Mar-a-Lago. We love it here.\\nIt is beautiful. You hear me?\\nOh, it’s gorgeous. I know what you’re thinking. “Do they allow Black people at Mar-a-Lago?” Um, we’re here!\\nRight? Laugh it off. We are Black-ish, though.\\nLast time we checked.\\nLast time we checked, we were.\\nYes.\\nAnd we’ve actually met the president. He saw us…\\nYes, we did.\\n…and he said that we are his two favorite Black people.\\nAnd he says it every single time.\\nEvery time. Mmm-hmm.\\n',\n",
       "  'Such a charismatic personality he has. He’s such a celebrity.\\nWe actually got married here.\\nUm, not in the big ballroom, but on the property. So it was still beautiful.\\nYes.\\nYeah.\\nWe’re not allowed in there right now.\\nWe’re not allowed in there yet, but there is a small room off to the side with a private entrance, very exclusive. [laughs] And they said we can go in there whenever we want. We can stay in there if we want to.\\nAnytime.\\nAnd then, one night, we actually got locked in there. And let’s just say it was very fortuitous.\\nYes, it got kind of hot in there.\\n[ominous music playing]\\nWe just love it here. Just surrounded by all our friends.\\nSurrounded by all of our friends, which is the most important part. We got you in our hearts.\\nRight on.\\n\\n[Sarah] If you like skateboarding dogs, you’re gonna wanna stick around after Everything’s Fine for Thinking Outside the Bachs with Jordana Bachman.\\n[Jordana] I don’t know what this is about to be, but okay!\\n[Sarah] Coming up at the twelve o’clock hour.\\nLet’s do the weather segment.\\nLove the weather. Love the weather!\\n[Lorraine] Mmm.\\n[theme song playing]\\nOkay, weather segment in three, two…\\nAnd now, let’s check in on how the sky’s doing today with our meteorologist, Andrea Steele.\\nThanks, Sarah. Well, we’re looking at some real clear skies today, up to 75 degrees. Absolutely beautiful out. Let’s look ahead at the five-day forecast. Tuesday, we’re gonna see a bit of rain, but break out that summer gear as temperatures shoot up to a whopping 103 degrees. Wednesday, out of nowhere, there’s gonna be a ferocious hailstorm with sustained winds up to 75-plus miles per hour. Scooter, you may wanna board up your windows.\\nMy windows are always boarded up. You know that weird house in your neighborhood that’s got all the boards up in the windows, and everyone thinks, “Is that an abandoned hospital?” That’s my place.\\nExcellent. Thursday, you might wanna break out the sunscreen again, because it’s gonna be a hot one. 123 degrees with a humidity index so high, a friend of mine who works at the EPA called me crying. He’s a grown man. Friday, we shoot down to negative 12 degrees with a windchill index we weren’t even able to calculate using a Doppler 8000 technology. It’s gonna be a cold one, folks. Most likely not survivable, so wear a jacket. And Saturday, temperatures radically return to breezy 75 degrees. However, that isn’t just a cute graphic we made up. We’re actually projecting literal flaming snowmen to be walking the streets with some possible fire tornado watches in effect. Everything’s fine with the weather. I’m Andrea Steele. Back to you, Sarah.\\nAndrea, I’m sorry, but that forecast is–\\nInsane? Uh, yeah. You think? I mean, I’ve been doing the weather for 17 years, Sarah, and I have never seen anything like this in my entire lifetime. You think I like telling people they’re gonna die, or their skin might peel off if they run to the grocery store? No one should be going outside unless they absolutely have to.\\n[heart beating]\\nScooter?\\n[narrator] Everything was not fine.\\n[exhales deeply]\\nScooter, are you asleep?\\n[narrator] Had the world gone mad?\\nAndrea, are you okay?\\n[scoffs] Am I okay? This b!tch. Am I okay? Um… No, actually, ’cause we got a bat disease just floating around in the sky, there’s a new natural disaster every motherf*cking day, factories destroying the environment. Look at this damn forecast behind me. This is the first time I’ve left my house in months! All it takes is one wrong motherf*cker to breathe on me funny, and I swear to God…\\nScooter, are we still on a nine-second delay?\\nThe woman who presses that button stopped coming in weeks ago.\\nWell, in that case, let me just say this. F*ck, sh!tty, doo-doo, b!tch, and stay the f*ck in your house. Reporting live from hell on earth, this is Andrea motherf*cking Steele. Back to you, Sarah.\\nThat was great. We’ll be right back.\\n[buzzer sounds]\\nGreat. We’re out. Nice.\\nWow.\\nSo that’s your house I walk by every day.\\n[Scooter] Yeah.\\nAh. My kids are terrified to go past there.\\n[chuckling] That’s the one.\\nIt doesn’t look like anyone’s lived there in hundreds of years.\\n[Scooter] That’s my place.\\n[Andrea] Interesting.\\nWell, it’s safe.\\nIt’s spooky.\\n[Scooter] Yeah.\\nIt’s awful there.\\nEverybody ready? Here we go. Five, four, three, two, one.\\nWelcome back',\n",

She was married.\\nThat’s huge news there.\\n[Trump’s voice] No, Nancy… This was… And I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said, “I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture.” Took her out furniture– I moved on her like a b!tch. But I couldn’t get there, and she was married. All of a sudden I see her, she’s now got the big phony tits and everything.

What a year. Guys, you should know anything about me, I gotta problem with people and how they behave, you know? I kinda grew up with like, a list of rules to kinda live by. My parents kinda gave me a book on how to live, and apparently, nobody got the book. Went to Starbucks, every day that’s all I do, is I watch people and I get upset, I can’t take it. I’m at the Starbucks, this woman ordered a scone, a muffin, I dunno what the hell it was, but they gave it to her in a brown bag and then she was eating it, she was like fingering the muffin outta the bag. Take it outta the bag! Get a plate! What the! What are you eating, crumbs?\\nI can’t take, everywhere I go there’s a problem. You can’t even go to the mall. I used to go to the mall all the time, it was a nice place to kinda unwind, but now they got these little, these huts in the middle of the mall, these little kiosks, what is this? I don’t buy anything out of a hut. I don’t even know if the hut’s gonna be there tomorrow if I have a problem with the product. These things are on wheels, they can be three miles down the road in no time. But we used to own that part of the mall, that’s where we made decisions, in the middle of the mall, right? We used to go with your family, used to go, “Where you going?” “I’m going to Sears. Where you going?” “JCPenney. We meet back here in one hour. ” Now you can’t do that, because you see a hut, you’ll be walking with your girl, you’ll look up there, you’re like, “Oh, come on. “What do we gotta put up with? “What is this hut?” ‘Cause these people that work in the huts are aggressive. These sales techniques are very aggressive. You ever get attacked with cream? Man, you’ll be walking, out of nowhere, “You wanna try cream? “Try cream, it’s good, it’s from Israel, it’s good cream. ” It’s hand lotion. They act like they got something that we’ve never seen before. Who’s trying the cream and going, “Oh, my God! “I’m soft, what the hell is this? “You have bottles of this back there?”\\nWeird stuff are happening in these huts. They’re threading eyebrows, have you seen this? A woman is laying down, and someone’s just. There’s eyebrows shrapnel flying everywhere. Landed in my Auntie Anne’s.\\nWorld is changing, man. After a while, went to Subway. Why is this a problem, getting a sandwich? It’s a sandwich. I got behind a lady, it looked like it was her first time out ever. Just a look of confusion, bewilderment. Came up to the counter. “How does this work here? “What do you do?” It says, “Step one: pick bread. ” You don’t see that? How do you make a sandwich at home? What, do you start throwing ham all over the table? Pick the bread! And she saw the condiments, her head almost popped off her body. She was sitting there looking at the condiments, telling the guy, “Not that tomato! “No, the third one underneath that one on the side. “I want that tomato. ” It’s not a puppy. Making up the, there’s rules at Subway you gotta follow. This woman’s like, “I don’t want any of those “cucumbers or olives, so double up on the turkey. ” It don’t work that way! The sandwich is $5, there’s a net profit of four cents on that! And you want double meat for no veg? And I feel for the guy working there. Gotta sit there and listen to this all day. He’s like, “I can’t do it! I can’t do it! “They got cameras, they’re looking at me! “Come on, what do you want?!” I got no patience for this. Just keep it moving. When you’re out just, just keep. I don’t hold it up. They guys asked me, “What do you want on your sandwich?” I told him, “Run it through the garden. “\\nIt’s everywhere you go. Grocery store, that’s always a problem, right? Customer s',\n",
       "  'ervice, they gave up. They grocery store gave up on us. They put in self-express checkout lanes. They basically said, “You know what? “You do it. ” Why am I working at the grocery store now? Do you ever look over there? Nobody knows what’s going on. It’s a bundle of confusion, right? There’s always a guy sitting there with like, some artichokes going, “Hahh?” We weren’t properly trained on this machine. Those people go through a three-week training on this computer, and we’re just jumping in on that? Again, I never wanna be the problem, okay? So, my grocery store is open 24 hours a day. You know what I did? I went in at 3AM. Nobody there. I did a self-training on this machine. I got all the different screens down, I memorized some of my favorite items, four-one-six-two: bananas. I know this stuff. So on a Saturday at 3 o’clock in the afternoon when it’s packed, I’m cooking. I’m helping out other people. But I was in the human line, I’m sitting there. My line ain’t moving. Had a price check, you ever get this? They’re sitting there, they scan the steak. Price doesn’t show up. Now they have to turn and ask Timmy, the bagger, to go and find out what the t-bone steak costs. And that person’s always like, “Yes, Timmy, “could you please, please go find out for me?” And now you hear the whole line just get deflated and pissed off at this one person because they didn’t pick out the right steak. I never wanna be the problem. If they scan my steak and it doesn’t show up, you know what I tell the cashier? “Forget it, I don’t need it, keep it going. ” You think I’m gonna wait for Timmy? Timmy don’t even know he’s working. This kid leaves here, he ain’t coming back. Was there even an interview with this kid? I dunno, I’m looking at the bagger, he’s got a rainbow mohawk, right? Then he’s got this, I dunno what it is, if it’s an earring, you ever see this? It looked like somebody took a shotgun and blew a hole through his ear and then they put magnets in his earlobe. Do you know what would happen to me if I ever came home as a kid with magnets hanging outta my ear? My father would throw me against the refrigerator.\\nSo I’m in line, I’m, I dunno, trying to be green. It’s hard, okay? I got plastic this time, right? And the whole line got upset. I could tell the whole line got upset at me with the plastic bags. I go, “Yeah, plastic. ” and the whole line’s like, “He’s not green!” ‘Cause they all brought their bag made outta wheat. You know what I do when I see that? “Double bag it. “\\nIt’s hot, I get frustrated when I talk about this stuff. You ever see somebody leave the grocery store and the alarm go off? That alarm constantly goes off. People walk off, right? And all of a sudden they hear, And what do they always tell you? “You’re good! “Go ahead! “You’re good!” You can have nine steaks down your pants. “Go ahead, take off! “Steal it!” So you get heated, man. When you’re out. Gotta stop often to cool off. What’s with, this whole town’s going nuts with yogurt. What’s going on with yogurt? Everybody’s dying for yogurt. They see a Pinkberry, they’re like, “I wanna go get some Pinkberry. ” I’m not a yogurt guy, but I had to go look to see what the problem was. I’m sitting in line, I’m watching people eat the yogurt. First of all, everybody had a sample before they got, what is with the sampling? I don’t do samples. These two women came up, so proud of themselves, they’re like, “Excuse me, do you have pomegranate? “Can we try the pomegranate?” They were so happy they were gonna get a free lick. Now the guy’s gotta turn around, he’s gotta fill up a little Dixie lick cup. And he hands it out. Grown women, but they’re like kids when they get it. They’re like, “This is good! I like this one!” I don’t do any of this. I just got the green tea. If I don’t like it, yeah, I fucked up. You think I’m gonna hold up 12 people’s day licking, “Yeah!” Driving, that’s another thing I can’t do. You ever get behind someone, they’re not moving? They’re not moving, right? You’re like, “Come on!” Right, you’re like, you change into an animal. “Come on!” You’re just looking for the pass lane. You’re looking to pass them. And it seems like it’s days, it takes days for this to happen. But you’ll finally get it, right? You’ll finally get it. But as you pass, you can’t let this go. As you pass them, you have to turn and look to see who the hell is driving this way. You can’t go to bed at night without putting a face to that mile’s prowl. And I dunno what happens to us. As we pass, we lose it. We’re like, “What the hell are you doing?!” Sometimes you wanna just slow up so they can see the face. You pull up and you’re like, “Look at what you did to me! “I was happy a mile ago, “look at this transformation!” Sometimes you gotta go',\n",
       "  ' back to your house and regroup, right? I was sitting in my house, couple weeks ago, just relaxing. My doorbell rang. This is weird. It’s a different feeling when your doorbell rings today opposed to 20 years ago, right? 20 years ago, your doorbell rang, that was a happy moment in your house. It’s called company. Be sitting there on a Thursday night, watching TV, your doorbell rang, the whole family shot off the couch. “Oh, my God! “Put the lights on! “Somebody’s here! “We got people!” The whole family went to the door. The kids were in socks. They slid up to the door. Nobody looked to see who it was. You just opened up the door. You were like, “Oh, my God! “Look at that! “Look at who’s here!” And you’d ask ’em, “What the hell are you doing here?” And the person’d be like, “I was in the neighborhood. “I thought I might stop by, see how the kids are doing. ” They’re like, “Oh, come on in! “We’re gonna have some cake!” Your mother had a little Entennmann’s. Be some Sara Lee crumble cake just in case company came over. She made an announcement when she bought it. She’s like, “Listen, nobody touch this cake. “This is for company only. “Those crap muffins, those are for you people. “You better hope to God somebody “comes over so we can cut the cake. ” She put her cake in the middle of the table, proud of it, and she put it right in the middle, “Cut yourself a slice. “Want a cup of coffee? “Want some Sanka?” That’s old school. Lot of the young kids are looking at me like, “What is that, an iPhone app? “What the hell is Sanka?” Your mother had a tin, brown and orange tin of Sanka ready to go just in case the company. She put a big pot on the table. “Go ahead. ” Nobody had a cell phone back then. If your house phone did ring, your father stood up and said, “Nobody get that phone. “We got company. ” And you lost track of time. Two hours went by, you were like, “We gotta get outta here. ” “That’s okay. “Next time we’re gonna come by you. ” “Yeah, my door’s always open. ” Now your doorbell rings? It’s like, “What the fuck?” Your own mother’s crawling across the kitchen floor. “Get down, ma! Army crawl! “Army crawl! Get in the closet. “Go get the sword in the living room. “Somebody get the sword underneath the couch in the living room. “There’s a sword. ” You have to turn and ask your family, “You invite anybody over? “You invite anybody over?” There was always that person upstairs that didn’t hear the bell. They come walking down, “What the hell is going on?” “Get the hell down! “Somebody’s outside! “They’re at the door! “I think they saw movement! “Oh, God! I gotta open it! “I got no cake! I go no Sanka! “I got nothing! “I got nothing for these people!” You can’t stop by anybody’s house anymore. If you do, you have to call from the driveway. You’re like, “I’m here. “Can I approach? “It’s me and three other people. “We’re gonna walk up through the side. “Is that your mother with a sword? “Why does she have a sword?” It’s all changing, man. And if you wanna see a big change, and see what’s happening in the United States, get called in for jury duty. Last week I was at jury duty the whole week. Am I the only one going to this stuff? I call my friends, “You going?” “Nah, we shred it!” What? So I go, 7:30 in the morning, right? 300 people. You sit there in this little room. And I dunno man, we’re in trouble as a country. If you wanna get a temperature gauge on what society is looking like, go to jury duty. They say it’s a jury of your peers. The people there are one step away from being a defendant. Nobody knows how to follow instruction. The guy’s up there, it’s simple, “Name. ” “Okay, name. ” “Address. ” “Address. ” And people are like, “Hahhh?” Then he opens it up for questions. “Any questions?” Worst thing you can do to the general public is start opening up a questions session. The hands that shot, this woman’s shoulder almost popped off. People love to hear themselves speak. “I have a medical condition. ” Nobody gives a shit. Fill out the form and go to the courtroom. The guy next to me, in broken English, asks me how to put his name tag into the laminate. And I’m like, “You’re gonna determine “whether somebody goes to prison “and you’re having problems with the name badge?” You need a release, right? You need to go out. You need to do stuff like this. Friday night comes out, “Come on, we’re going out, we’re gonna do stuff. ” I went out last week to a nightclub. I can’t do this anymore. I’m getting way too old for the nightclubs. You know you’re old when you walk into a nightclub and you’re like, “Is it loud in here? “Why’s my hair vibrating?” I can’t dance anymore. I used to bounce around. I was able to dance. Used to go out in my early 20’s, I had my Cavariccis on. Mighta had that belt',\n",
       "  ' that shot down. Used to ask girls to dance. That’s what we did, we went out dancing. All week long we practiced at the house and then Friday night we tested it out. Guys would have confidence, man. Girls would be hanging out by the bar. Guy would have enough confidence to pick out the one he wanted and ask her to dance. Real cool, we’d come up, we’d be like, “Hey. “How you doin’? “You wanna dance with me?” And she’d turn around, she’d be like, “Yeah, “I’ll dance with you. ” She’d turn to her girlfriends, “Hold my purse, Joanne. ” And you’d go out to the dance floor. You wouldn’t touch one another. Very respectful, you’d just watch each other move. You’d be like, “Yeah. ” You had that stupid dance face. You’d lean in, “You look fantastic. ” Then you would go to the bar ’cause that song would come in that nobody could dance to, right? That song would always pop on. Like, “I can’t dance to this. “Can’t dance to Whitesnake. “Let’s go get a drink at the bar. ” So you would go to the bar. This is where you would have to have a little personality. Flirt with her, right? I grew up with a group of guys who were all funny. That’s what we’d do, make fun, goof around with girls, make ’em laugh. Girls’d be like, “Ohhh You guys are funny!” I’d be like, “Yeah, I know. ” You would go in for the kill, you would get the number, like, “Why don’t you write your number down on a napkin? “I’ll take you out for some steak next week, huh?” And you would get the number on a napkin. It was kinda damp, right? The ink would bleed a little bit. Before you left the club you had to ask her, “Excuse me, sweetheart, is this a seven? “Did you write a seven?” You give your number out now, five minutes later you get a text message, “What are you doing?” What do you mean what am I doing? I just met you. Back off! It’s weird now at these clubs. It’s embarrassing. Men look like predators. They look like predators on the dance floor. They don’t ask girls anymore. They just come right behind them. They’re like This is flirting? Somebody wanna call the authorities? These nightclubs. Go to the bathroom at a nightclub. That’s a whole different sub-culture in the bathroom. They gotta bathroom attendant in the bathroom. They put this guy in here about 15 years ago and his sole job is to give you a towel after you’re done washing your hands. From here to your hands. Now, I dunno if that was a problem for people. I dunno if people were coming outta the bathroom wet, “What do I do?! “I’m wet!” So management said, “You know, listen, “they’re not grasping the concept. “They’re coming out, they’re drenched, they’re soaked. “We need to put a guy in there to distribute towels. ” And as soon as you walk in and you see him you get pissed off that he’s even there, right? You walk in, you see him, you’re like, “Oh, God! “They got a guy!” It’s weird! Now you gotta talk to him after you’re done, you’re like, “Yeah, smells like crap in here, huh?” And you gotta tip him a dollar for the towel, for what? I could see if I took a crap in a sink, “There you go man, sorry about that. “Little screwed up tonight. “You wanna wash that out. “Maybe light a match, some Febreze, “a candle, do something! “I’ll give you a dollar. ” It’s weird man, but the world’s changing, I dunno what’s wrong with people. Go to the club, they got, everybody’s gotta tattoo now. Oh, my God! I can’t believe it! All the guys will get one, right? They’ll put one on their bicep. Now every shirt becomes a sleeveless. They gotta billboard their tattoo. They gotta show it off because there’s like an emotional meaning behind it, right? Some idiot will come up, “Excuse me. “Hi, I’m sorry. “What the significance? “Why do you have a cobra head on your bicep? “What?” Now the guy gets all emotional, he’s like, “Thanks for asking. “The reason I got the cobra, “five years ago my father, excuse me, “my father got bit by a snake. “So to remember him by, I put the snake head “on my bi, it’s not done yet. ” It’s never done, right? They always gotta go back, get shading. “2019 I’m gonna have the whole cobra “all over my body. “For now, it’s just a head, but what’s gonna happen, “it’s gonna drape across my chest, “it’s gonna cascade down my torso, “the tail’s gonna wrap around my nutbag. “Don’t laugh, it’s for my dad, you know? “It’s gonna creep around my back, “the rattle’s gonna tickle my nipple, “and on my nipple it’s gonna say ‘Dad “rest in peace’, you know?” What the hell are you doing to yourself? What, did you forget he died? What, do you look down in the shower, “Oh, yeah!” People ask me all the time, “Sebastian, why don’t you have, “why don’t you get a tattoo?” I go, “I don’t put bumper stickers on Ferraris. ” But that’s what we do, we go out as a society. That’s all we do, is go o',\n",
       "  'ut. Go out to dinner with your friends. That always gets weird, especially if you go out with a group and you go out for anything, like a dinner or whatnot, and when the bill comes, it gets weird. ‘Cause what normally happens is the bill will travel around the table. People will then begin to pitch in what they think they owe. The problem with this is there’s always somebody last to get the bill. A look of confusion and concern comes over their face. They’re like, “One, two, three, four. ” Now, people see this and they’re like, “Need a couple extra dollars or something like that?” They’re like, “Well, I’m $687 short. “So the two bucks you’re gonna pitch in “ain’t even gonna put a dent in this. “So how ’bout this, how ’bout “the bill take another lap? “Do another lap. “I don’t think my chicken tenders were 700.” That’s one way it might work, right? Sometimes you’ll be out to dinner and somebody picks up the bill at your table. Now, there’s a game involved with this. If somebody’s nice enough to pick up a bill, you just don’t go, “Hey! “Thanks!” No, there’s a game. Somebody takes the bill off the table, you have to stand up and lunge, lunge for the bill. You lunge but you don’t touch it! ‘Cause if you touch it, you might end up with it. You’re like, “I never wanted it. “I just wanted to act like I did. ” So you stop shy, “What the!” And you act like you don’t know, you know exactly what’s going on, but you have to act like you don’t. You’re like, “Come on, what are you doing with that? “Come.. ” Now the person will go, “Please, come on. “I’m making a lotta money, you know that. “I got this tonight. ” The person doesn’t sit down. You have to come back with number two. Now, you go fish for the money. You’re like, “That’s ridiculous, it’s a lotta money. “Hold on here,” right? And you go for the money, but the money’s back here. You just shake a pocket hoping they cut you off. If that person has any class they’re like, “Please, come on on. “You’re embarrassing yourself. “I got this, get it next time. ” You have to come back with number three. “At least let me leave that tip down. “Come on, huh?” Now the person will then say, “Your money’s foreign. “I got it all. ” Now, I’ve been in situations where I go, “Let me leave the tip,” and the person’s like, “Sure, go ahead,” I’m like, “You cheap bastard. ” You might go out with a group, you might go on a date. Some people go dating, right? It’s what a lot of us doing, right? Nice couple here, hugging her, gripping onto her, “It’s my girl. ” It’s nice, it’s love all about. The first date’s the big date, though. You go on a first date, there’s a lotta flags, lotta red flags going off on that first date. I watch how a woman eats, this is a huge deal-breaker for me, okay? Took a girl out a couple months ago for Italian. She ate everything on the plate. I got no problem with that. – Yay! – Yeah I got no problem, do it all you want. The problem I had is she then took a piece of bread and did a sponge job. My father does that during the holidays. You might wanna wait ’til we fall in love until you start mopping up sauce with bread fragments. Another deal-breaker, when I go to the girl’s house for the first time. Ladies, be prepared for the come-over, okay? Have some options for me. You come to my place, I’m ready for you. I have it. It’s like a hotel. Soon as we walk in, I turn around, “Want a little Diet Coke? Apple juice? “Wine? What do you want?” I got Orangina. Nobody’s got Orangina. Throw that at a chick, “You wanna glass of Orangina?” “You have Orangina?” “Yeah, I got it. “Sit down. ” This girl had nothing. We walked in, she turned around, she’s like, “You want some water, something like that?” Water? I’ll get that outta the hose.\\nLittle things bother me. I dunno. Another girl, she offered me some scotch. I said, “Yeah, can you put that on the rocks?” So she brought it out, I went to go take a sip, I smelled the ice cubes, the ice cubes smelled like her freezer. I’m like, “What is this, Johnnie Walker “and mixed vegetables? “Change out your cubes!” Every three days I’m breaking cubes at my house, fresh. It’s what we do, though. Dating in the beginning’s cute, though. God, everything’s adorable, isn’t it? Nobody can do any wrong. You guys been dating for a while? About a year now. – Yeah, a year, it’s cute, right? There’s no arguments, everything’s adorable. He walks into the kitchen, she’s got a little broccoli hanging off her head. It’s the cutest thing he’s ever seen. He comes in, he’s still flirting, he’s like, “Baby, you gotta, “you gotta piece of broccoli hanging off your head. ” She flirts right back, she’s like, “Oh, sorry. ” You get married, you have kids. That ain’t funny anymore. Little things are pissing you off about that person. ',\n",
       "  'Never bothered you in the beginning, right? Now little things, just the way somebody brushes their teeth in the morning could set you off. You walk in, you look at ’em in the mirror, you’re like, “Oh, look at this shit. “I hate you. ” You might get engaged. That’s the next step. Now, most guys, I like a classic go to a knee. That’s what I think men should do. Drop to one knee. I think that’s what about 90% of the guys do, right? Soon as the guy goes to the knee, soon as he does this, the girl sees what’s happening, she gets excited, she’s like,. Guy will drop down, he’ll get a little emotional, he’s like, “Baby, “you know, we been dating for 18 years, you know? “I know you’re 48, you probably can’t have kids anymore. “I think I’m done clubbing. “I think I should maybe settle down, you know?” And you put the ring on her finger, she’s like, “Oh, yes. ” Some guys get stupid with it, right? They’ll be out at dinner, they’ll be sitting there, and the guy’ll be like, “Look in the mashed potatoes. ” “Yes. ” Now you gotta plan the wedding. I come from an Italian family. Italians do it a lot different than most people when it comes to weddings, okay? Italians don’t register at Bed Bath and Beyond. We don’t bring a toaster to a wedding. Italians bring cash, okay? We put it in an envelope, sometimes there’s not even a card, there’s just cash with a post-it note, “Congrats. ” Now, the bride and groom know they’re getting cash. They’re sitting there with a satin bag that says “Cash” in diamonds. And people walk in and, you know, they start making a deposit. Now, some people don’t give the cash right away. They hold onto it. They wait ’til dinner’s served. They go to dinner, they’ll have the dinner, they’re eating the chicken. They go, “The chicken’s kinda dry. “Take a hundred outta the envelope. “The food stinks. Take a hundred out. ” Then at the end of the wedding, the bride and groom, they go up to the room, and before they do anything, they start opening up these envelopes. Now, the groom takes out a black log book. And what they’re gonna do, they’re gonna log the amount and the name in of everybody that came to the wedding, right? So the guy will be, “What’d the Pentangelis leave?” She’s like, “$10,” like, “Cheap bastard, $10.” The reason for this book is when the Pentangelis get married you go back to the book and you look, “Pentangeli. Put 10 singles in that envelope “and tell them to screw themselves. ” That’s how I did it. My father, cash. That’s all, he had a wad of cash growing up, no wallet, just the wad, just a big knot with a broccoli band around the wad. We’d negotiate. My father would negotiate prices at Sears. It was embarrassing to go shopping with the guy. The salesman didn’t know what the hell was going on. The salesman like, “The refrigerator’s “gonna be about $1,200, here. ” My father’d be like, “No, it’s not. “We’re gonna pay cash. ” The salesman was like, “Yeah, we accept cash, sir. “$1,200.” My dad like, “Cash. “What’s the price gonna be with cash?” It’s not a flea market! We’re at Sears! I didn’t grow up in a huge family. I have a sister. But, I dunno, I dunno if I wanna have kids of my own. It’s coming to a point now where my friends all have kids. They’re always asking me, “Sebastian, when are you?” I go, “I dunno if I want kids. ” They’re like, “What? “Oh, no! “Sebastian, kids are a miracle. “It’s an amazing thing. “Once you have one of your own it’s not about you anymore. ” “It’s about them. ” Why the hell would I wanna do that? And it’s not the kids I gotta problem with, it’s the parents today. It’s a different parent than how we grew up. First of all, is everybody’s kid fantastic? Why is everybody bragging about their kids? Don’t we have any dumb kids anymore? My parents were honest with people. They never bragged about me. We went to the aunts and the uncles, as soon as we walked in, my father was like, “Yeah, we don’t know what the hell’s wrong with him. “I dunno, something’s off with this kid, something’s loose. “Look at how big his head is. “Look at the head on this kid. ” They put me in the back, “Go in the basement. “Play pong. ” Now I got my friends always coming over with their kids. Bragging, “Sebastian, she’s so advanced. “She’s reading at a fourth grade level, “she’s only in second grade. “Show Sebastian the face, show the face you make!” I don’t give a shit. If your kid could fly from my backyard to the front yard, yeah, I might wanna see that. “She’s unbelievable! “How’s it happening?!” But whatever your kid does, nobody cares! They got their kid in every sport nowadays, every activity. What are you doing? The kid’s exhausted. Pick one thing for this kid to do. But no, the father, the mother can’t fathom that the child just might not be good at som',\n",
       "  'ething. It’s never the kid’s fault for lack of talent. It’s the coach. You ever get this family, they gotta complain to the coach? They come up to the coach, “Coach, wanna come here? Yeah. ” “Hi, we’re the Gibsons. “Just wondering why my child Tyler’s not participating “in the game with the rest of the kids?” “‘Cause he stinks. “It’s why we gotta bench. ” Not everybody’s a winner. Not everybody gets a trophy. You know who got the trophy when I was growing up? First place got the trophy, right? Yeah, that’s it. It inspires competition, right? They don’t even keep score in the games. I couldn’t believe it. I came to my buddy’s kid’s game late. I said, “George, I’m sorry I’m late, what’s the score?” He’s like, “We don’t keep score out there. “All those kids are winners out there. ” “Are you watching the same game I’m watching? “Kid’s running the wrong way. ” I didn’t grow up this way. My parents prepared me for life. Disappointment, failure. They put me in basketball. They came to the first game. At half time my father sprinted down from the stands like, “Get the hell in the car, you suck!” He’s apologizing to the coach, he’s like, “I’m sorry you had to watch that. “I dunno what the hell he was doing out there. ” Even I knew I was bad while I was doing it, I’m like, “I don’t feel good! “Get me off!” He pulled me right off the court, he’s like, “Listen, you humiliated yourself. “You embarrassed our entire family. “People took off work to watch what you just did. “Get in the truck. ” Italians, we don’t play basketball. When’s the last time you put an NBA game on and said, “Take a shot, Nunzio!” It doesn’t happen! “Put in Carmine for the three!” No! Italians, what do we do? Cement, nice cement driveway. Meatball sandwich. Give us a church, we’ll paint the whole ceiling. Certain cultures do certain things well. Italians generally do not go into the medical field, right? Have you ever went to an emergency room and like, “This is your doctor, Doctor Aquilani. ” I’m like, “Wait a minute, you got a Ginsburg back there? “A Leibowitz, a Falkenberg, somebody I knew that studied?” Come on! But it’s culture-based when it comes to raising kids. The culture that’s got it down to a science, in my personal opinion, are these Japanese people. We got any Japanese tonight? You Japanese? – Half – Half. I knew she wasn’t 100% because Japanese people are quiet. I never asked that question, a 100% Japanese, “Yeah! We’re here!” It doesn’t happen. That was her other half coming out. Japanese people, well-mannered people. You ever look at their kids at a restaurant? They’re trained. They sit there in a 90 degree angle. They’re like soldiers. They don’t move. They make one slight move, the father’s like, You ever see the white kid at the restaurant? In half a diaper? Mother just sitting there, “Ha ha, isn’t he cute? ” Look!” No, you know what’s cute? The two year old Japanese kid in a suit eating with sticks. Asking for the check. Two years old, in third grade. But you have a family, maybe. It’s hard to stay married. Peaks and valleys. Lotta men veer off the path of monogamy, right? Celebrities do it all the time and the media focuses in on these celebrities. Mostly guys, right? Probably the biggest celebrity to ever veer off the path is Tiger Woods, right? And they put the guy in a sex-addiction clinic. That’s what they do nowadays. They put people in sex-addiction clinics. There is no such thing as a sex-addict, okay? How do you know you gotta problem with sex? You hit a certain number, you’re like, “Oh, I need help. ” This whole thing is a scam. The only guys that are at the sex clinic are guys that are married and got caught. There’s no single guys at the clinic. There’s not single guys banging on the door. “What’s the problem?” “I dunno, I’m having too much sex out here! “Something’s wrong with me! “It’s awful! “My buddies are laughing at me! “I don’t know who’s coming and going. ” Anytime any of this stuff happens, it ignites conversation in house between men and women, right? A lot of women sit there and watch it on ESPN or CNN, they’re like, “Can you believe what he’s doing? “Can you believe this?” A lotta guys have to sit there and act, “What? “How many girlfriends does he have? “17? That’s disgusting! “Shut it off, I can’t even watch. ” Some women, they take it a step further. They compare the celebrity relationship with their own. You can’t do this. Two different worlds, right? Tiger Woods worth a billion dollars and women were sitting there, “Will you do this? “Would you do, look at me! “Would you do this?” You can’t ask your guy that. If you asked him, you’d have to, you know, guys would have to say, “Listen, honey, “the guy’s worth a billion. “If I was worth a billion, I wouldn’t be with you. “I',\n",
       "  '’m working at Walmart. “This is the best I could do. ” Come on, do you think the guy at Walmart is dealing with the same temptations that Tiger Woods is dealing with? Do you think there’s six foot blonde Scandinavian models walking into Walmart asking the stock guy, “Hey, wanna little of that? “Tell me where your towels are, this is all yours. ” It’s getting weird, man. World is changing. And I dunno if it’s for the better. Lotta technology out there. I’m not into it. Craigslist is a big, big website. People go there. First of all, have you gone to the Craigslist website? It looks like it came out when the internet came out. Does anybody wanna put up some flash? Looks like braille. But people sale stuff on this with no problem. I dunno, I can’t do this. It’s weird, this Craigslist. You don’t know who’s coming to your house, right? It’s like an invitation to get murdered. Just put up the posting, “Area rug for sale. “Come murder me and my family. ” You don’t know what you’re getting. We used to have a garage sale. That’s how we did it. We just threw the garbage on a Saturday morning, just threw it out on the driveway. We put some signs all over town with an arrow, “Come get our garbage. ” And the weirdest people would show up to your home. You would have a table with a cash box and the garage opened, but you would just watch people mill around your yard, right? They’d come outta their cars. Some would get a little too close to the house, you’re like, “Back up! Back off! “Back off! What do you want? “Tell me right from there what you want!” “Can we use your bathroom?” “Bathroom? Get the hell off my property! “It’s not Walmart, it’s a shit sale. “Pick what you need and leave. ” And whatever we didn’t sale, we threw it out! But we broke it before we threw it in the garbage. That’s my father, he’s like, “If they’re not gonna buy it “at my sale, they’re not gonna come by later on tonight “and steal it outta my garbage. “Saw the couch in half. ” What? 12 years old, I’m sawing! He’s like, “Burn all the lamps. “Burn all these lamps. “Pop the eyeballs outta the teddy bear “and then decapitate the head. “You throw the head out on Tuesday “and then the body out on Saturday. “I know who was looking at this bear, “and when they come back and find out “there’s no eyeballs or no body, “they’re not gonna want a head. “\\nIt’s a weird, weird culture out there, man. ‘Cause that technology’s taking over. My father wants to get involved with it. Now, my father is an immigrant, came here from Sicily when he was 15 years old. This guy’s been cutting hair his whole life. Not tech-savvy whatsoever, right? Calls me up the other night. He lives in Chicago, I live out here in Los Angeles, calls me up, he’s like, “Yeah, wanna learn internets. ” Now, I dunno if anybody’s ever taught anybody the internet over the phone. It’s virtually impossible. You can not use internet terms with someone who doesn’t know a computer. And I found that out right from the get-go. I said, “Dad, you gotta open up your window. ” He’s like, “Why? I got two feet of snow outside. “Is that for better reception? “You get better reception that way?” What? Reception? You gotta dummy it down. You gotta explain exactly what they see. I said, “Dad, there’s a blue ‘e’. “Do you see a blue ‘e’, with like a sphere? “Do you see that?” I said, “You gotta click that twice. ” He’s like, “Why twice?” And I’m like, “Yeah, why twice?” For years, I been doing two. One, you get nothing. Two, it happens. Said, “Dad, I dunno, just click it twice!” So he goes, “Is that what the foot pedal’s for?” Foot pedal? He had the mouse on the floor. It’s not a sewing machine! “What are you doing?! “Put the foot pedal on the desk! “What the hell are you looking at? Tell me!” He’s like, “I think I broke it. “I got pipes, I got pipes!” “How old is your computer “that you still have the pipe screensaver? “Is it beige? “Is it a Presario? What do you got?” I said, “Shake the foot pedal to get rid of the pipes!” I said, “Dad, come on! “On the top do you see a white bar?” I was gonna say cursor, he ain’t gonna get that. “Is there a stick blinking in whiteness? “Do you see this?” He’s like, “Yeah, I see it. ” I said, “Type in www. yahoo. com. ” He types it in, presses return, he’s like, “I got nothing. “You gotta call the internets and tell ’em “I got no website. ” I said, “Read it back. What is it?” He’s like, “I got wwwdoty-” “You spelled out ‘dot’?” I’m trying to get the guy to email, right? So I finally get him there, I said, “Dad, call me when you send it. ” He called me back, he’s like, “Yeah, I sent it. “I dunno when you’re gonna get this. “Could be five, six days depending how busy “Yahoo is, I dunno. ” I said, “Dad, I’m looking at it!” So I open up the email, the entir',\n",
       "  'e email is in the subject heading. I’m like, “What the… ” It’s scary, man, right? And the older I get, the worse I get. I’m a huge hypochondriac. I constantly think I’m passing away. I constantly think I’m dying. I woke up one morning, my hands were dry, I’m like, “Oh, come on, what, am I disintegrating? “What’s happening?” Now, with this use of technology, anything medically, I don’t go to the doctor. You know what I do? I go right to Google. You will admit stuff to Google that you won’t tell a soul. If Google ever comes out with a printout of what you’ve been asking it, you’re gonna have to leave California. I type in, “I got dry hands, “what does that mean?” Now a bunch of stuff comes back with Google. Google, I stay on page one, I never go to page two, I’m always on page one. I don’t even know what’s on page two. A horse is involved all the time, I dunno what it is. I’m always on page one, first three topics, right? I’m gonna try and self-diagnose what I have based on other people’s stories and anecdotes. This is the worst thing you could do to yourself. The first story I read, they guy’s like, “I had dry hands three months ago and now I got no fingers. ” What? So that’s it, I think I’m dying. I don’t eat, I don’t sleep. Three and a half weeks, I lost 15 pounds. My friends were coming up to me going, “Sebastian, you look fantastic. “What the hell have you been doing?” And in my head I’m like, “I think I’m dying. ” So I went to the hospital. Go to the hospital, go to the doctor. I walk in, I go, “Take a look. “Look at this. ” He goes, “Oh, hold on, let me go take a look at something. ” I go, “Where you going, Google? “I was just there, it says I’m gonna lose my fingers. “What do you know?” He’s like, “I’m gonna write you a prescription “to get some lotion. ” Now, this is always a problem, going to your local pharmacy to get medication. I dunno why, you give your slip to the pharmacist, he always looks at it, he’s like, “Oh “It’s gonna be about another 25 minutes. “If you wanna walk around Walgreens, “about another 25 minutes. ” And I’m like, “It’s right there. “It’s right on the shelf. ” But you never question the pharmacist. You’re always like, “Oh, okay. ” I didn’t take the walk, I stood my ground. I go, “You got it, right?” He’s like, “Yeah, we got it. ” I go, “Why would I walk around?” He’s like, “There’s people ahead of you. ” I go, “No, they’re not. “I’m staring right at you. “Where are they?” He’s like, “They’re walking around Walgreens. ” What? Nobody could tell me why I’m taking this walk. For years, I swear to God, I thought people were making medication in the back room. I thought there was some guy filling up little caplets going, “Tell ’em walk around! “I can’t get the damn things on, they’re too small! “I need another 25 minutes, I got 30 caplets!” So I took the walk, I came back, there’s a person in front of me, and there’s a line, I didn’t see this the first time, there’s a line on the floor with two footprints. And it says, on the floor, “For the privacy of the person “in front of you, please stand behind the line. ” Now, the person is right here. I’m right here behind the line. You’re telling me this much I can’t hear nothing? Right here, right here, no idea what’s happening. Right here, “He’s got gonorrhea!” Every time you come outta the pharmacy there’s always a homeless guy there. I dunno why this is. I love to give to the homeless, don’t get me wrong, but I get attacked nine, 10 times a day for change, I don’t have this type of change for the demand. So I give, but I give once a day. And how, I base it on how they approach me. They guy today had an amazing approach. Beautiful posture. Made direct eye contact. Came up, asked me very nice, he’s like, “Hey, you gotta couple quarters? “I’m down on my luck. ” I said, “There you go, man. “Sorry to hear that. ” He walked his way, I walked mine. There was no problem. But sometimes they scare the crap outta you, right? They’ll fall out of a bush. They got some screwed up walk. Like, “Why am I gonna give you anything? “You took no time with your presentation. “You got 24 hours a day and this “is the best you could come up with?”\\nI dunno what’s wrong with people. It’s all changing, man. And I’m glad you guys came out tonight to watch some live entertainment, because I don’t even know what they’re giving you on television. American Idol, this is a huge, huge thing. What is it? It’s your neighbor. You turn it on, you’re like, “Isn’t this Kyle from Kinkos? “What the hell is he doing on televison?” No, I grew up with entertainment, man. Musicians that created something, an image, a costume. When Michael Jackson first came out I lost my mind. Oh, God! Yeah! He came on MTV, I’d stop what I was doing, it was like an event',\n",
       "  '. I’m like, “Ma, look at this! He’s a.. “He’s got one glove. ” Do you know the talent you have to have to come up with one glove? Nobody gave him this outfit, the guy had to think of this. Sitting in his house after Off the Wall, he’s like, “How am I gonna top 8,000,000 sold? “Go get me one glove. ” What? “Yeah, and go dip it in diamonds. ” Do you think he stopped with the glove? He’s like, “You know what? “Go do that with my socks. ” Then he looked at himself in the mirror, he’s like, “They’re not gonna be able to see the socks. “Hem the pants eight inches off the ground. ” What? And not only did he pull it off, the whole world was doing it. I was doing it! I had the red jacket with the zippers and the cheese graters on the top. I would put Michael Jackson moves into conversations. I’d come up to my mother, I’d go, “Ma, you think I could get a popsicle?” We were all doing it. That’s talent.\\nPrince, remember when this guy first came out? Four foot two? Four foot two with high heels! I didn’t even question that. Purple Rain? The movie changed my life. Remember that motorcycle he had? Eight times too big for him? Remember when he pulled up to Lake Minnetonka? He’s sitting on his bike with that black jumpsuit, that mane for a hairdo, that shit around the mouth, whatever the hell that was. His little boots. Size two boots. Apollonia was this guy’s girlfriend’s name. Could you imagine meeting this couple at a party? Be like, “Hey, how you doing?” “My name’s Prince, this is Apollonia. “What’s your name?” You’re like, “Shit, I gotta go change it. ” What do you come back with? “My names John, this is Carol. “What the hell are you? “Are those mini boots, what do you? “Is that lace around your wrist? “Who are you?” I wanted to be Prince. I’d walk around my house, outta nowhere, “Dearly beloved. “Dearly beloved. ” My mother’d be like, “What the hell did you just say?” Mother, I said, “Dearly beloved. ” Now what do we got? American Idol? Some idiot from Montana singing a song in his t-shirt with his entire family in the front row telling America to vote, “Vote! “Vote for our child so we can all have a better life!” Fuck your kid. He stinks. Put him in the truck.\\nThank you guys, you been fantastic. Thank you so much.

Tomlinson shares her journey towards understanding herself and the world around her, touching on everything from the flawed advice of married friends, the absurdities of dating apps, to the challenges of staying true to oneself in a world obsessed with appearances. Through personal anecdotes that range from a robbery that turned into a dating disaster to the trials of navigating single life and confronting her own insecurities and ambitions, Tomlinson crafts a narrative that’s both relatable and thought-provoking. Her reflections on the quest to “have it all” and the realization that true fulfillment might not come from societal achievements but from embracing one’s unique path resonate deeply, offering laughter and a subtle critique of contemporary culture’s fixation on perfection and external approval.\\n\\n* * *\\n[crowd cheering]\\n[“Boys Wanna Be Her” by Peaches playing]\\n[rowdy electroclash rock music playing]\\n[emcee] Ladies and gentlemen, Taylor Tomlinson!\\n♪ The boys wanna be her ♪\\n♪ The girls wanna be her ♪\\n♪ The boys wanna be her ♪\\n♪ The girls wanna be her ♪\\n♪ The boys wanna be her ♪\\n♪ The girls wanna be her ♪\\nDC, how we doing?\\n[cheering in response]\\nHow stupid was that?\\n[audience laughing]\\nI came up from the floor like I’m a fucking Jonas brother. I know that was silly, and it was my idea!\\nI was so embarrassed that I thought of that, but it was too late when we got here to change it because men with jobs had built it. And were operating it very well, I might add. And I was like, “We can probably just scrap it, right?” They’re like, “Well, this is like a week of our lives, so…”\\nI know that that was dumb. Thank you for indulging me. [chuckles]\\nHow we doing, DC? Thank you so much for coming.\\n[audience cheering]\\nI have to be honest, my career is going very well right now. I…\\n[audience cheering]\\nThis is the last night of the biggest tour I’ve ever done. I am filming my third Netflix special tonight. And recently, someone was using my name and photos on a dating app.\\n[audience wooing in response]\\nIt was me. I was doing it. Went through a breakup, got on a dating app. Why? Because my married friends told me to. If you’re single, your married friends don’t want you to be happy. They don’t. They want you on those apps because the apps look fun and they can’t go on ’em. So they want to stand behind you like a kid at an arcade with no fucking quarters, while you fight for your life out there.\\nThey’re like, “Go left, go right!” You’re like, “Do you wanna play?”\\nThey’re like, “More than anything.”\\n“But I have the high score, so it wouldn’t be fair.”\\nYour married friends don’t want more married friends. Nobody wants more married friends. Sorry if you’re married. I know you’re up front. Two-income household.\\nNobody wants more married friends, okay? ‘Cause your life updates are boring. I’m happy you’re settled. Good for you. Know who has fun life updates? Your single friends. We’re out there, making mistakes. Named Trevor, usually. Have you asked married friends what they did over the weekend?\\n“What’d you guys do?”\\n“I don’t know. Just woke up next to my soulmate… again.” [giggles]\\nAsk your single friend, “What did you do this weekend?”\\nThey’re like, “I woke up in a shallow grave!”\\n“Why are you proud of that? Did you have sex in a grave?”\\nThey’re like, “Why do you think we dug the grave?”\\nDo you have that one single friend who thinks she’s hot and fun, but she’s actually just in constant danger all the time? Every time she tells you a dating story, you’re like, “Oh my God, okay.”\\n“No, we’re not judging, but maybe just share your location with us indefinitely.”\\nI have one friend like that. Every week she tells me the scariest stories I’ve ever heard in my life.\\n“I had the hottest date Friday. I’m making out with this guy at a bar. So sexy. He’s like, ‘Let me show you something.’ Pulls me into the back alley. Pulls out his huge… gun. Points it at my face. ‘Gimme your phone, keys, and wallet.’ Okay, kinky. I’ll try anything once.’ Right? He hits me in the head. I wake up 30 minutes later in a puddle. I hitchhike home. Oh my God, I am such a Samantha.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nWe’re like, “We think you got mugged, babe.”\\nShe’s like, “Mugged? You’re such a prude. He’s gonna call me. He has my phone. You’ll meet him. He took my breath away.”\\nWe’re like, “No, he knocked the wind out of you.”\\nYour friends say the dumbest shit when you go through a breakup. Trying to be helpful.\\nLike, “Well, why don’t you just date yourself?”\\n“‘Cause you told me not to settle. What the fuck?”\\n“I can do better than me!”\\n“Why can’t you just be single for a year?”\\n\\n\\n\\n“Why can’t you walk without headphones?”\\n“‘Cause you’ll think about death the whole time. Exactly.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nThis last breakup was different.\\nThis was the first breakup I’d gone through since I got on Netflix.\\nAnd before I was on Netflix, my friends were very supportive.\\nLike, “We’re so sorry. It’ll get better.”\\nThen I got on Netflix and went through a breakup, and all my friends were like, “Well…”\\n[audience chuckling]\\n“I mean, you have your dream job, so…”\\nMy friends looked me in my sad face and went, “You can’t have it all, bitch.” All of them',\n",
       "  '!\\nAnd I was so offended.\\nI thought about it, and I was like, “Know what?”\\n“I don’t want anybody to have it all.” None of us do.\\nIt’s why they keep putting out Marilyn Monroe documentaries.\\nThey’re like, “She was pretty sad.”\\nAnd we’re like, “Yeah, she fucking was.”\\nNobody wants anybody to have it all. If someone has their soulmate, you don’t want them to have their dream job too. If someone has their dream job, they don’t get to be in love on top. If someone has their dream job and their soulmate, bare minimum, their parents better be divorced. I’d prefer they were an orphan.\\n[audience laughs]\\nNobody wants anybody to have it all. When I was a kid, I didn’t think you could. I thought you either got to be hot or have a good personality. I thought that’s how we’re divided. I thought life was fair. That got me through a lot of ugly years as a child.\\n“It’s okay that I’m not more symmetrical.”\\n“I have this great personality that will surely reveal itself any day now.”\\n“It’s coming with my period and my Hogwarts letter. I can feel it.”\\nThat got me to sixth grade, when I met my friend Krista, and she was pretty, funny, smart, and nice. And that’s when I stopped believing in God.\\n[audience laughs]\\nBut so many friends said a version of this to me after my last breakup that I started to feel really guilty. Because you know what, DC? This is my dream job. I can’t believe I’m filming my third Netflix special tonight. I cannot believe it.\\n[audience cheering]\\nI have been so insanely lucky in my career. And the more I thought about that, I was like, “Nobody has every single thing going for them as a person. You have been so blessed. Be grateful for what you have. Focus on that. Nobody gets to have it all.”\\nAnd then I saw Hugh Jackman in person.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI was like, “I guess you can have it all. But there’s none left because ‘God’ gave it all to Hugh.”\\nHugh Jackman is a perfect specimen of a human man. Seeing him in person was a religious experience. It changed me. It was like seeing the Grand Canyon. Everyone should do it before they die. He is a wonder of the world, that man. It was like seeing Niagara Falls. You can bring the whole family. You get a little wet, but it’s fun. It was…\\n[laughter, applause]\\nHere’s what happened. About a year and a half ago, we were in New York, doing shows on tour. We had an off night in between theater shows. So me, my buddy Dustin, and his wife, Melissa, and a few friends, who were also happy, went to go see The Music Man on Broadway, starring Hugh Jackman. Was it a good show? I don’t know. But Hugh Jackman was there the whole time. They should’ve called the show,\\n“We got Hugh Jackman in a room. Who wants to see him?”\\nThe show was great. At the end, they’re doing curtain calls. The actors are taking their bows. One of the actors steps forward and goes, “You’ve come on a special week, Tonight we’re raising money for an amazing charity called Broadway Cares. Tonight Hugh is gonna sign the pair of gloves he wore in the show. We’re gonna auction them to the highest bidder.”\\nAnd I looked at my friends, and I was like, “I mean… I have money.”\\nThey were like, “This is what you’re gonna spend the Netflix money on?”\\nAnd I was like, “Well, I don’t have a family.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“There’s no one else here, and I’ve already had braces. If I can’t have it all, I’m gonna have those gloves.”\\nAlso, I thought it’d be hilarious as a bit. Because everybody asks you when you get on television, “What’d you spend that money on? A new jacket? A new car?”\\nAnd I’m like, “How funny would it be if my first big TV purchase was a pair of sweaty gloves worn by Wolverine,” right? [chuckles] It’s like, what am I, a man? So dumb.\\nI start competing in the auction, and I’m doing pretty well. ‘Cause I got nothing to lose and no one to live for. I’m doing so well, it gets down to me and two other bidders. It gets down to me, an older woman towards the front, and I kid you not, Jake from State Farm. That is 100% true, that detail, and I hesitate to include it because it makes the story sound like a dream I had once.\\n“So in the dream, I’m trying to get Hugh’s gloves. Jake from State Farm thinks he’s gonna get ’em. Fat chance, commercial boy. Those are mine.”\\n“Then Flo from Progressive rides in on a horse for some reason.”\\n“Whoops, who’s that?”\\n“Tony the Tiger pops a wheelie on his motorbike.”\\n“All-cash offer.”\\n“You can’t beat Tony. That’s old money.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSo it is now me, this woman, and Jake. I think what happened next was Jake could tell that me and this woman needed the win more than he did. So like a good neighbor, State Farm backs out.\\nYep. It is now me and this woman. We are ping-ponging, back and forth. I think I blacked out because when I came to, we were at a number that I’ve not agreed to pay since college. So exactly like college, I’m like, “This is crazy. I’m not gonna finish.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nAs they’re about to say, “Once, twice, sold to the woman in front,” Hugh Jackman steps forward, stops the auctioneer, and goes, “Before we end the auction, I just have to say, I am so moved by the generosity of tonight’s audience. You know, I have two gloves. If I were to sign both of them, would these two ladies match each other’s bid?”\\nAnd he looked right at me. Now, I’ve never paid for sex…\\n[audience laughing]\\n…but I did drop seven grand on eye contact with Hugh Jackman.\\n[audience laughing, clapping]\\n[cheering subsides]\\nThank you for clapping. That joke was expensive.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThey’re like, “It’s a tax write-off.”\\nI’m like, “Don’t worry. I will make sure that it is.”\\nI wish I could tell you I was like, “It’s for charity.” But the truth is, I completely forgot till the end.\\nEven then, I was barely listening. I was busy talking to the glove. Like, “Hugh’s fingers were inside you. What was that like?”\\n“He’s surprisingly gentle.”\\n“I knew it.”\\nI love that story ’cause I can always tell who grew up in church based on who starts laughing at “You know, I have two.”\\nYou’re like, “Oh, I read the Bible. I know when they’re about to cut a baby in half.”\\nI don’t think the dating app thing is for me, by the way. Don’t think I can do it.\\nIs anyone in here on dating apps?\\n[light applause, whooping]\\nOkay, has anyone in here never been on a dating app?\\n[louder whooping]\\nI don’t care for that. Wish I hadn’t asked. The smugness o',\n",
       "  'f those whoos. I hated every second of that. If you’ve never been, let me tell you what it’s like. Every dating app profile, you get six photos of what look like six different human beings. Then you go and sit in a coffee shop and wait for him. Like, “Come on, picture number three. Come on, picture number three.”\\nAnd then he gets there, and you’re like, “Goddammit, it’s four.” But you can’t just leave. You gotta sit there for 45 minutes, nodding and smiling, knowing you’re gonna ghost him later. You feel creepy. You feel like Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. Just like, “Oh, he doesn’t know he’s dead yet.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nDating is so awkward, especially dating apps. A dating app date is not a blind date, but it is a nearsighted one, you know? The first date’s easy. You get dinner, drinks. That’s basic. But then they’re like, “This was fun. We should hang again. What should we do?” You’re like, “Well, shit. I’m not a person with hobbies or interests. I’m basically just a stack of frightened possums in a trench coat, doing an impression of someone I saw on the street eight years ago. So then you gotta go home and get online like a loser. Date Ideas, 2023.”\\nWe could bowl. Ever drive past a bowling alley? “How do these stay open?” Second dates, that’s how. We could bowl or mini golf. Is laser tag a real thing? You’re just doing shit church youth groups do when they’re trying not to touch each other.\\nJust, “Lace up those bowling shoes, my man. You’re either gonna commit to me or Christ tonight. Can’t finger these holes. You can finger those. Pick your ball. Pick your ball.”\\nI’m an introvert, and I think that’s why dating’s harder. Extroverts are better. You like getting to know people. You’re into it for some reason. That’s why you’re better at casual sex. When you think about it, a one-night stand is meeting someone as hard as you possibly can.\\nI’ve never been able to have casual sex as an introvert. I can’t relate to my male comic friends in green rooms when they’re talking shop about road sex.\\n“Yeah, I had sex with this girl and then lost interest after I came.”\\nI’m like, “Totally. That’s how I feel after I poop in a Barnes & Noble.”\\nRight? ‘Cause it’s like, “I got what I came for. We can go.”\\nThose are my most fun friends to talk to. My friends who have casual sex regularly, I always want to hear their updates. I have a friend on Tinder. I call her every Monday.\\n“How was your weekend?”\\nShe goes, “Great. Remember that guy I told you about? He is so good at dirty talk, Taylor.”\\nI’m like, “What’s good dirty talk, in your opinion?”\\nShe goes, “I really like being called a slut and a whore.”\\nI’m like, “Oh my God.”\\n“If you like being called a slut and a whore in bed, your parents loved you so much.”\\nDirty talk is hot because it’s shit you’ve never heard before. Ooh! If someone called me a whore in bed, I’d be like, “Excuse me? That’s what my father calls me. That is a family name. Boundaries, sir. Look around. Is this sex or Thanksgiving?” Read the room.\\nI wanna hear shit in bed I’ve never heard. I wanna hear like, “Hey. I set up a college fund for you.”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“I think your arms look too thin. I really enjoyed your Netflix special.”\\nI have some daddy issues. I’m working on ’em. In therapy. Not in my relationships, not anymore. I used to put my dad and ex-boyfriends in the same group text and write in all-caps, “I don’t feel pretty today. Whose fault do we think that is?”\\n[audience member] Yeah!\\n“Discuss.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\n\\n\\nThat worked better than it usually does. I’m worried about you guys.\\n[audience laughs]\\nThat one’s usually for me. Are we all right? I really like you guys. You guys are great.\\n[audience laughing, cheering]\\nAnother friend is such an extrovert, she’s gonna have a threesome with a guy she’s dating.\\nI was like, “Really?”\\nShe goes, “Yeah. Would you?”\\nI was like, “God, no.”\\nI don’t even want to hang out with two other people. I’ve never been in the middle seat on a flight, fighting for an armrest, like, “Wish we were all naked. That would be cool.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI don’t think I could date an extrovert again. I dated an extrovert once. We moved in together. The first week, he’s like, “Hey, what if we had some people over?”\\nI was like, “Look, if you don’t wanna be with me, just say so. You want to have people over? Over what? My dead body?”\\nIf you’re an extrovert in love with an introvert, you gotta understand, asking us to invite people over is like asking us to do anal. Watch our face change.\\nLike, “I’m sorry. Is it your birthday?” Seems like a big ask for a random Tuesday.\\nI live alone now. It’s incredible. I fall asleep in the middle of the bed like a boy king. “Good night, Joffrey.” It’s fantastic. I eat all the food I buy. Every grocery goes in me or it goes bad. That’s power, DC. Yeah.\\nIf I clog the toilet at home, I don’t have to deal with it right away. That’s freedom, DC.\\nWhen I lived with a man I was attracted to, I was like, “Please, toilet. Don’t tell him I’m a human woman. I beg of you, take my dark secrets to your watery grave. Remember our bargain!”\\nNow I’m like, “You loser toilet, that’s what lids are for! You wanna see the sky? Do your job.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nI was so afraid of being single all throughout my twenties. I was terrified of being single. I used to jump from relationship to relationship. ‘Cause I was so scared that I was gonna die alone. Now that I’m older, I’m like, “I’m not gonna die alone.” I don’t go hiking by myself, all right? Someone will be there when I die. A doctor, a murderer, someone will bear witness.\\nI’ve been single for the last year now, and it has been the most relaxing year of my entire life.\\n[audience cheers]\\nIt has been lovely. Waking up every day going, “Oh, no one’s gonna make me cry today but me.”\\nThe peace, it’s lovely. Here’s the thing. Being single is not what sucks. Dating is what sucks, and you can opt out of that. Dating is what’s shitty. The constant push and pull of hope and disappointment. Dating feels like being a stuffed animal in a claw machine. Like, “Oh my God! It’s happening! No, it’s not. Oh my God, here we go. Can’t believe I told people! That’s embarrassing.”\\n[Tomlinson tutting]\\n“You’re moving me over to get to something else. I understand. I get that.”\\nThings change so quickly as you’re getting older. I had ',\n",
       "  \"a friend. I didn’t talk to her for a couple weeks. I called to catch up. She goes, “You’ll never guess. I think I met my soulmate on Bumble.” Gone, just like that. They’re getting married this spring.\\nWe were lying in the same pile of stuffed animals for years. I closed my eyes, and when I open ’em, she was outside the glass going, “It’ll happen for you too!”\\n[audience laughing]\\n[Tomlinson exhales]\\nI love being the neutral friend who’s not dating because as you get closer to 30, breakups get more and more devastating. Half my friends are engaged, half are going through the worst breakup with the person they were gonna die with. Which means half the calls I get are, “I’m getting married,” and the other half are, “I’m getting old!” And I’m like, “I am getting Taco Bell. Who wants something?” Taco Bell, good for every occasion.\\nNothing’ll make you more grateful to be single than watching your friend go through a devastating breakup. That’s messed up to say, but it’s the truth.\\nI have a friend who went through a breakup still follows her ex on social media. They’re trying to be mature and evolved. Rookie mistake. Her ex just posted a photo of him and his new girlfriend, who is a model.\\n[audience winces]\\nDon’t worry. We all called her. We’re like, “Hey, how’s it going? Have you been online today? Because we were thinking of maybe doing a no-screens day. We were thinking maybe we just power down, get a quilt, find a field. Maybe crack the Bible open one more time. I don’t know.”\\nShe’s like, “I already saw it.”\\nWe’re like, “Oh, we’re too late. Okay. Um, are you okay?”\\nShe’s like, “No, honestly, I wish he was just dating a man instead.”\\nWe’re like, “Oh, you are so problematic, Trish. Why would that be better for you if he was dating a man instead?”\\nShe goes, “No, listen. ‘Cause if he dumped me for a man, it would be like, ‘Well, okay, then he just wanted something that I could never be.'”\\nWe were like, “Well, yeah. I mean, that’s kinda… well… Right?”\\n“No, no, no! No! No. No. No, you’re so pretty, babe.”\\n“But like a model? That’s kind of like a different…”\\n“Look around. Don’t you think if you were a model, we’d all be models? Like, this isn’t model squad. This is personality squad. Like, this is a different… team you’re on.”\\nWe have another friend who got cheated on, which is crazy. You can’t cheat anymore. It’s not the ’90s, you idiot! Your phone is tracking your every movement. You’re going to get caught. You’re gonna buy your side chick flowers. Your wife’s gonna get a text from Bank of America. Like, “We noticed that Steve was being thoughtful?”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“That just seemed like suspicious activity… over here at BoA, ’cause we know that POS.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nIt’s important to hang out with married friends if you are the single one. You play an important role in their lives. I love to third-wheel my married friends, go to dinner, see a movie. ‘Cause I love when they walk up to meet me in front of the restaurant and I can tell that they’ve been fighting in the car.\\n[audience laughs]\\n\\n\\n\\nMarried people think you hide it so well. You’re just like, “Let’s just table it till later and have a nice evening.” Then you come in real sweaty. [in stilted tone] “Hey. Good to see you. Glad we’re finally doing this. Did they bring bread? The bread should’ve beat us here.”\\n“Hey, can we get some bread, please? Can we get something to do with our hands other than attack each other, please? How are you? Tell us about you. Don’t make me look at her. Don’t make me look at her.”\\nThat’s when you, as a single friend, tell your married friends about dating. You get to tell them about the ghosting, the catfishing, and the deepfake AI porn. And you know, they get back in the car a few hours later like…\\n[shaky, relieved sigh] “I don’t say this enough, but I’m grateful for you.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nHang out with your married friends, go to their barbeque.\\n“I’d love to come. What can I bring? Ice? Dessert? Perspective?”\\n\\nWant to know the best part about being single? The best part, hands down, is that you do not have to introduce anybody to your parents. Have you guys introduced people to your parents? It’s not about introducing people you love to one another. Is it? No! It’s about showing your partner why you’re mean to them sometimes.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s about taking your sexual partner back to the scene of the crime. To say, “See? The stories are true.”\\nYou don’t want your partner to like your parents. You want them to walk out of that night going, “Oh my God. Your parents are just…”\\n“I know. I know.”\\n“Seriously, babe. How did you ever…?”\\n“I don’t know. I don’t know. Kinda seems like people should cut me some slack when I’m being a bitch, though, huh?”\\n[audience laughing, whooping]\\n“Kinda seems like maybe now that we have all the information, turns out I could be a lot crazier if I wanted. But I keep a lid on it pretty good, and… I deserve to stop at Target on the way home. With no time limit. And I want a cart. Not a basket.”\\nBe careful when you introduce people to your parents. Your parents don’t always show up as your parents, do they? Mine never did. My parents undermined me every time I brought someone to meet them. I did everything right. I did the huddle in the car before.\\n“Hey, remember, those people in there, they’re not your friends. Whatever they say, do not take that personally. It’s not you. It’s them. You want to write that on your hand? You can look at my tattoo if you get scared. Let’s do it.”\\nThen you go inside, prepared for your parents to show their true colors, and your parents float downstairs. And they’re just amazing all night. They’re fun, cool, laid-back. Your dad’s in an open Hawaiian shirt. Just a one-man conga line, topping off drinks. Saying all kinds of progressive shit you’ve never heard him say.\\n“You want another beer? We should golf sometime. What are your pronouns again?”\\n[mouthing] What the fuck?\\nAnd you gotta get back in the car later, muttering like a conspiracy theorist.\\n“That was not… and I was there, and I know what happened, and it was right there. No one can tell me what didn’t happen, and I know about everything.”\\n[Tomlinson muttering]\\nYour boyfriend buckles up, like, “I don’t know, babe. Your parents are awesome.”\\nAnd you’re like, “Ugh. No, they are not. I don’t know who those lizard people \",\n",
       "  'were, but they are not the ones who broke me.”\\nThe next time you see your parents, they’re all smug, like, “Jason seemed to like us.”\\nYou’re like, “I know what you’re doing.”\\n“Maybe your therapist wants to meet us. Get our side of the story.”\\n“I cannot wait till you’re in the ground.”\\n“All right, well, we’d like to be cremated.”\\n“I will scatter your ashes where God can’t find them!”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“I will see you both at Easter.”\\n\\nTherapy gets better when you’re single too ’cause you have time to dig into things like that.\\nWhen you’re in a relationship, you waste half of every session going over all the shit your partner won’t go to therapy for. When you’re single, that’s an hour of you every week. It’s almost too much time. You gotta start doing your homework. After my last breakup, I was coming into therapy hot every week with ideas.\\n“You know what I realized this week? The elementary school I went to? Across the street from a cemetery.”\\nAnd she’s like, “Okay. And…?”\\nI’m like, “I don’t know, but that seems like something, doesn’t it? I bring the ingredients. You bake the cake. I’m not a doctor. I went down deep inside me, found something scary, brought it back up to you. I was so brave. Where’s my treat?”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“So brave, favorite client!”\\n\\nI want to find out if I’m my therapist’s favorite client. You can’t ask. They won’t tell. I’ve tried. The only way I can think to figure this out is to get in touch with another one of her clients. And then me and that client plan to call her, over the weekend. Separately. At the exact same time… suicidal.\\n[audience laughs, winces]\\nAnd then we just see whose call she takes. We both wanna end it. Who you want to keep here, Dr. S? And then whoever wins, we go to the next set of clients. And we just kind of do brackets. Sort of like a March Sadness situation.\\n[audience laughing]\\n\\nI’ve been working on anxiety in therapy.\\nThat’s been my focus for years. Anybody have anxiety?\\n[audience cheers]\\nAnybody struggle with panic attacks?\\n[audience cheers]\\n\\n\\n\\nHas anyone ever gone to the emergency room for anxiety or panic attacks?\\nA few of us!\\nWhat did we think was happening? Heart attack?\\nYeah. You get there, and they’re like, “It’s actually your mind attacking you.”\\nI’ll make you feel better.\\nI went to the ER once because I fell asleep in AirPods.\\nWoke up, couldn’t find one.\\nThought I swallowed it.\\n[audience laughing]\\n“You meant you drove halfway there and turned around ’cause it was silly?”\\nNope. Went the whole way. Got seen.\\nI wish I could pretend this story happened a really long time ago,\\nbut the technology involved makes that impossible.\\nI’ve always had a lot of trouble sleeping my entire life.\\nAnd before AirPods came out, I would fall asleep in regular headphones, listening to a podcast or a movie, something to calm me down.\\nBefore AirPods came out, headphones had cords on them.\\nSo if you swallowed one, you’d pull it out like a magician scarf.\\nThey came out with AirPods. I started falling asleep in those.\\nSo a few years ago, doesn’t matter how many, I fell asleep in two AirPods, woke up in one AirPod, and was like, “Well, obviously, I swallowed it.”\\nLike a baby or a dog.\\nConvinced my sister to take me to the emergency room, ruining Christmas morning for everyone.\\n[audience laughing]\\nWe get to the emergency room in our hometown, where I have to tell three grown women at the front desk what I’m doing there.\\nI’m like, “You probably get this all the time.”\\n“But it would seem that I may have inadvertently in my sleepy-sleeps swallowed an AirPod?”\\nAnd they were like…\\n[stifling laughter]\\n“An AirPod? Sweetie, those are pretty big.”\\n“Those are big.”\\n“You think you could have swallowed…”\\nI said, “How about we don’t have a team discussion about what I can and can’t swallow, okay?”\\n[audience laughing]\\nThey’re like, “Someone was ugly in middle school. We’ll take you back.”\\nSo, they take me back.\\nWe’re waiting for a doctor.\\nI don’t know what I thought a doctor was gonna do if I had, in fact, swallowed an AirPod.\\nThey’re not gonna perform surgery.\\nThey’re gonna go, “Yeah, it’s in there.”\\n“Well, stop at Taco Bell on the way home. Good luck.”\\nTaco Bell, good for every occasion.\\nI don’t know what I thought the AirPod was gonna do to me damage-wise.\\nI’m like, what if it’s still charged? What if it electrocutes my intestines?\\nOr starts playing Glee covers and everyone can hear?\\nMy sister’s like, “You deleted them all.”\\n“Not all of them. Some of them are bangers!”\\nBefore a doctor can come in to see us, my other sister calls us from home and goes,\\n“Hey, yeah. We found it in the pillowcase.”\\n“Does crazy want to come home and have pancakes now?”\\nI’m so embarrassed.\\nI want to sneak out the back as quickly as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\nI’m like, “Let’s just go.”\\nMy sister’s like, “They’re gonna think something bad happened.”\\nI was like, “Something bad did. Let’s go!”\\nShe’s like, “That’s an emergency exit.”\\nI’m like, “It’s an emergency room. It’s a regular exit. Let’s leave!”\\nHere’s my problem with the emergency room.\\nWhen you are having an anxiety or panic attack, it is your only option.\\nWhich is why I think they need a second option next door called “the Anxiety Room.”\\nAll right?\\nSo you have the ER and the AR.\\nThe ER is where you go when you’ve been shot, stabbed. You’re actively bleeding.\\nYou fill out all that paperwork ’cause that seems like the time to do it.\\nAnd then the AR is where you go when you’re like, “I don’t know where the bad is, but it’s in me somewhere.”\\n“It’s either cancer or the devil, but I have to get it out.”\\nAnd that is just one fill-in-the-blank form that says, “I know that it is probably fine, but…”\\n[audience laughing]\\n“My bones feel itchy. I don’t know!”\\n“I just need someone in a white coat to tell me I’m stupid.”\\nI know I mentioned during that joke I have trouble sleeping.\\nPlease, for the love of God, do not DM me articles after this show.\\nI know you mean well, but I promise you I’ve read every sleep article out there.\\n“Three ways how to sleep better!”\\nIt is the same recycled tips over and over and over.\\n“Get a light lavender mist to spray on the cold side of your pillow at twilight.”\\nWhat am I, a witch?\\n“Make sure it’s really dark and quiet in your room at night.”\\n“Oh my God, it’s supposed to be dark? I’m such a dumb bitch.”\\n“I’ve been sleeping under a disco ball. Because vibes',\n",
       "  \".”\\n“I didn’t know!”\\n“Okay. Dark, quiet, check. Fixed!”\\n“Why not leave your cell phone in a different room at night?”\\n“Why don’t you put your baby outside?”\\n[audience laughing]\\n[audience cheering]\\nThis is not to say that I’m against sleep advice. I’m just jaded.\\nI think I feel about sleep tips the way a lot of men feel about porn.\\nWhere I’m like, “No, I’ve seen all the basic stuff.”\\n“Send me something weird.”\\nI’m gonna ask this question.\\nLet me preface this. It’s okay if nobody has an answer.\\nI ask every audience every night. It’s nothing weird.\\nIf you think that you have a weird sleep tip I’ve never heard of…\\nI’ve read every article, listened to every podcast, seen a lot of TikToks.\\nI ask this question to every audience, every night of this tour.\\nIf you think you have a weird sleep tip that I have never ever heard of, raise your hand and tell me what that is.\\nThat being said, if anybody goes, “Have you tried the Calm meditation app?”\\nI will have you removed.\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt’s okay if no one has one. Does anyone have one?\\nWe got a confident one right here.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat have you got?\\n[audience member 1] Masturbate.\\nMasturbate?\\nBitch, please.\\nYou think I haven’t tried masturbating?\\nI don’t go to sleep. I come to sleep. Next.\\n[audience laughing, cheering]\\nAll right.\\nWhat else we got? Thanks for playing.\\nWhat have you got?\\n[no audible reply]\\nThere’s two things?\\nAnd I do them in order? Okay.\\n[audience member 2] You have to do a handstand.\\nI have to do a handstand against the wall? Okay. Yoga, no.\\nThis sounds like I need to be hotter for this. I can’t.\\nWell, all right. I just want to hear the end.\\nSo you do a handstand against the wall.\\nJust a couple seconds.\\nJust for a couple seconds. Just easy, breezy, beautiful cover girl.\\nThis is how hot people talk.\\nThey’re like, “Just do a handstand for 10 seconds. It’s no big deal.”\\nYou’re like, “Some of us are top-heavy.”\\nAll right, anyway. Sorry, go ahead.\\nYou need to be upside down.\\nAnd then you sleep upside down.\\nI haven’t heard the handstand part, but I have heard sleep upside down.\\n‘Cause it changes the bed, yeah.\\nIt confuses your body. Yeah, confuse yourself to sleep. Okay.\\nThat’s one. I’ve half-heard that one.\\nOkay, so we’ll half give it to you.\\nAnybody else think they have a weird one? Really weird.\\nIt’s okay if nobody does.\\nI’m just curious. Who said “Whoo”?\\n[audience member 3] Whoo!\\nAll right, what do you got?\\nListen to him talk.\\nListen to who?\\nThis guy.\\nListen to the guy you’re with talk?\\nAre you trying to get left?\\nOr are you trying to offload your partner right now?\\nYou’re like, “This one’s available.”\\n“He just talks and talks. You fall asleep eventually.”\\n“This dude right here.”\\nWow, okay. That was fun.\\nWe all stepped in a divorce. Wasn’t that a good time?\\nThat’s the first time that’s happened when I ask that.\\nEvery night, never one of those.\\n“Take this boring piece of shit home.”\\n\\n\\n\\n[audience laughing]\\nAll right. Last one. What you got?\\n[audience member 4] Listen to someone’s random phone calls in the other room.\\nI listen to my mom have a conversation with my grandma…\\nYou eavesdrop on somebody’s… phone conversation from the other room?\\nYou listen to your mom talk to your grandma?\\nDid you miss the whole part where I said I am alone?\\n[audience laughs]\\nAt least the last girl offered me someone.\\n“Have you tried falling asleep to the sound of people who love you in the other room?”\\nI would that I could!\\nOkay, well, those hurt my feelings.\\nI’m gonna tell you the best one I’ve heard on this tour.\\nIt was a few months ago.\\nA woman in the front row. “I have a weird sleep tip.”\\nI said, “What you got?”\\nShe goes, “When I can’t sleep, I lay on the floor in the kitchen for 10 minutes.”\\nAnd I was like, “Okay. And then what happens?”\\nShe goes, “Then I get back in bed. I go to sleep.”\\nThis poor girl abusive-parents herself.\\nShe’s like, “Aw, you can’t sleep?”\\n“You know some kids don’t have beds, right?”\\n“Go lay face down on the cold tile for 10 minutes.”\\n“See if you’re not more grateful after that.”\\nAnd you know what?\\nI tried it, and it works.\\nIt totally works.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI do it on the bathroom floor in hotel rooms.\\nI’ve had COVID many times, but… I want to get a handle on my anxiety.\\n‘Cause if I didn’t have anxiety, I’d be totally different.\\nThe worrying alone takes up so much mental and emotional energy every day.\\nIt doesn’t help.\\nIt doesn’t prepare you for anything bad happening.\\nI told my therapist recently, “I know worrying doesn’t do any good.”\\n“What’s that quote by that philosopher? ‘When you worry, you just suffer twice.'”\\nShe goes, “Who said it?”\\nI looked it up. It’s from a fucking Harry Potter prequel.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI was so confident, I Googled it in front of her.\\nShe’s like, “What philosopher said that?”\\nI’m like, “Newt Scamander. Shit.”\\n“Think it was a fortune cookie. Can we move on?”\\n“I don’t want to talk about it anymore.”\\nWithout anxiety, I’d have a totally different personality because so many decisions I make in life are fear-based, or so many decisions I don’t make are fear-based.\\nI watch the same shows and movies over and over because it calms me down.\\nI know what to expect.\\nI date the same type of person over and over ’cause I know what to expect.\\nIf you think you have a “type,” you don’t.\\nYou have anxiety. See someone.\\nI have three younger siblings.\\nThey’re all Gen Z, they’re all queer, they’re all in serious relationships, and they’re all so disappointed in me every time I start dating another straight white guy.\\nThey’re like, “Come on, Taylor. Fuck the patriarchy.”\\nI’m like, “You guys, I’m literally fucking the patriarchy.”\\nDo you know how hard it is to continue dating straight men when you’re surrounded by three queer relationships up close?\\nQueer relationships are the most beautiful, thoughtful, creative things\\nI’ve ever seen in my life.\\nMy sister and her partner are in a romance novel.\\nEvery time I talk to them, I’m like, “I know you had a hard week. You okay?”\\nShe’s like, “Yeah. I did.”\\n“To cheer me up, my partner got me my favorite snack in a limited edition flavor, they got me sand from the beach we went to on our first date, and you know how I always wanted an Easy-Bake Oven and never got it?”\\n“They found one on eBay.”\\n[audience laughs]\\nI’m like, “Oh my God, are they cheating on you?”\\nShe’s like, “What? No! They listen to me and remembe\",\n",
       "  \"r things I say.”\\nI’m like, “What? No, go through their phone.”\\n“This shit stinks. Go through their phone. Trust me.”\\nShe’s like, “Okay. How are you and your boyfriend doing, Taylor?”\\nI’m like, “Oh, we’re good.”\\n“My boyfriend bought me a hot dog\\nbecause he wanted one and I was there too.”\\n“It was so romantic.”\\n“He was like, ‘What? Sorry. Two, I guess.'”\\nI don’t mean to shit on straight guys. I’ve dated a lot of you.\\nBut you are so proud of yourselves for almost nothing in a relationship.\\nIt is impressive to watch.\\nA straight man will put a candle in his bathroom and be like, “I’ve changed my whole life for you!”\\nThen you’re like, “You didn’t even light it, man.”\\n“It kind of smells like lavender if you get down real close.”\\n“I’d trade this candle for a slice of empathy, if I’m being honest.”\\nHave you tried to explain the concept of empathy to a tall, handsome white guy?\\nThat is a delicate conversation.\\nYou’re like, “Okay. Imagine that you’re me.”\\n“But I’m not.”\\nOkay.\\n“Hard to argue. Touché.”\\n“Imagine that you feel how I feel.”\\n“But I don’t.”\\n“Okay.”\\n“Imagine that you could feel how I feel.”\\n“I never will.”\\n“Okay. Imagine you’re a basketball player.”\\n“Okay.”\\n[audience laughs]\\n“What else? I like this game.”\\n“Fine, in this analogy, you’re a basketball player.”\\n“And you’re a really great teammate.”\\n“You love your team. You do everything for your team.”\\n“Your team is not noticing.”\\n“Your team is not appreciating you for all you do, for the MVP that you are.”\\n“And this week, your team forgot your birthday.”\\n“Now, how does that make you feel?”\\n“That sucks!”\\n“Yes!”\\nTrying to get a hot guy to empathize is like trying to get a woman to come.\\n“Nobody move!”\\n“We’re so close. It’s a car alarm.”\\n“Stay focused, please.”\\n“Worked so hard.”\\nI’ve been trying to figure out if I’m bisexual or if I just binged Euphoria too fast.\\n[audience laughing]\\nI’ve been trying to date women, but I dunno how to get women to like me.\\nI know how to get men to like me. Easy. You trick ’em.\\nJust wait until they kind of like you, and then you’re like, “You don’t like me.” They’re like, “Yeah, I do.”\\n“You don’t.” “Yeah, I do.”\\nYou’re like, “No, you don’t.” “I do!”\\nYou do that until they get you pregnant, I think.\\nYou just turn it into a fun challenge for ’em.\\n“Bet you can’t spend your life with me.”\\nThey’re like, “Fucking watch me, you bitch!”\\nLike when you ask a kid to take out the trash, and they’re like, “No!”\\nAnd you’re like, “I’ll time you.”\\nAnd he’s like… [gasps]\\n“See? You didn’t even think you wanted to do that.”\\nHe’s like, “Who cares? I’m the fastest boy alive.”\\nHitting on women is so much harder. It feels so much more delicate.\\nHitting on a woman feels like trying to skip a stone on a lake.\\nHitting on a man feels like throwing a brick through a window.\\nLike, “I don’t really care. I just want to see what happens.”\\n“I’m not gonna live here.”\\nI might be sexist.\\nI’m hearing it now as I’m talking.\\nI think I’m sexist because when a man rejects me, I’m like, “This idiot!”\\nBut when a woman rejects me, I’m like, “She knows what she’s talking about. Um…”\\nI was talking to a friend of mine about it because you don’t wanna just…\\nIt’s scary to just say you’re bisexual ’cause then someone’s always like,\\n“Prove it. Here’s a pic of Margot Robbie. Are you wet? Lemme feel.”\\nEveryone’s really…\\nEveryone’s aggressive about it. It’s weird.\\nYou’ve got to prove it to people.\\nUh, but I was asking my friend about it, and she goes,\\n“Obviously, sexuality is a spectrum.”\\nShe watched Euphoria too.\\nShe goes, “I know that I’m straight. I could not go down on another girl.”\\n“I think that’s gross.”\\nI was like, “Okay. Let’s think about this.”\\n“Why are you not going down on a girl now? Is it gross to you?”\\nAnd I was like, “No, it’s not that it’s gross to me.”\\n“It’s that I really don’t want to be bad at something as an adult.”\\nMy brother is trans, my sisters are gay, and I identify as afraid.\\nI am so afraid of failure.\\nI can’t even stick with new hobbies as an adult.\\nHow am I supposed to get good at…\\nGetting good at going down on women would be like learning piano.\\nI would love to have that skill.\\nBust that shit out at parties, impress everyone.\\nBut I don’t have the time or humility to sit down and learn new fingerings.\\nI don’t have it.\\n[laughter, applause]\\nI get halfway through “Jingle Bells.” I’m like, “I suck.”\\n“I should’ve started at 12. I’ll never catch up.”\\nI already know how to play clarinet.\\nIt is not my passion, but I have the respect of my peers.\\nI have many years of experience under my belt.\\nUnder someone’s belt, under some belts.\\nWhen I was a kid, I didn’t know there was another option.\\nThey were like, “You’re a girl, play clarinet.”\\nI was like, “What about piano? Could I play piano?”\\nThey’re like, “Sure, you can play piano if you want to go to fucking hell!”\\nAnybody, religious trauma?\\n[whooping]\\nDo we have any of that in here? Okay.\\nI’m sorry if you don’t have any. I know I’m a broken record.\\nI should shut up about it, but I keep realizing new things.\\nFor example, did you know when you come,\\nyou’re not supposed to yell, “Take that, Jesus!”\\nDid you know that?\\n[laughter]\\nI wish that was a joke, DC.\\nI really do.\\nEven if you didn’t grow up religious, a lot of people grew up sheltered.\\nRound of applause, how many people did not get a sex talk?\\n[audience clapping]\\nRound of applause. Yeah, see?\\nNow, round of applause, who did get a sex talk growing up?\\nWho did get one?\\n[audience cheering]\\nYou did. Do you mind me asking how old you were?\\nIs it okay I’m talking to you? I want to make sure.\\nIf I talk to you and you’re not into it, that’s completely fine.\\nI wouldn’t talk to a live entertainer.\\nDo you consent to crowd work?\\nI need a verbal yes. Not just a thumbs up. Yes?\\nSee? Not that hard. That’s how it’s done.\\nAll right.\\nAll right. How old were you when you got the sex talk?\\n[audience member] Nine.\\nNine? Okay.\\nThat seems a little early but also kind of okay.\\nI don’t know how tall you were at nine. Right?\\nWere you asking questions, or were your parents like, “It’s time”?\\nMy mom took me for a picnic in the garden.\\nYour mom took you for a picnic in the garden?\\nFuck you so hard.\\nAre you serious?\\nYour mom took you to a picnic in the garden to tell you the horrors of sex.\\nI’m sorry. I’m having an emotional reaction to that.\\nThat’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever heard.\\nThis Secret Gard\",\n",
       "  'en sex talk.\\nHoly shit, okay.\\nWow, what’s that like, Lorelai Gilmore?\\nFuck me.\\nSo you weren’t asking questions or anything?\\nYour mom was like, “It’s time…” Oh, you were asking questions?\\nSee, a lot of people ask questions.\\nAnd I didn’t realize all these kids were so smart.\\nI didn’t know we were supposed to be. I never asked any questions.\\nWhich is so stupid, now that I think about it.\\n‘Cause when I was a kid, before I got my period, I had three holes.\\nI still do. I don’t know why I said it like that.\\nI still do. For the record. Just for anybody watching…\\nI’ve always have had, always will have.\\nI think. When you get your tubes tied, do they seal it off?\\nI’m gonna Google it. Forget this.\\nThis was a tangent.\\nI’ll deal with this on my own.\\nBut before I got my period, I had three holes, and one of the holes wasn’t doing anything, right?\\nAnd I never thought to ask anyone around me, “Hey, what’s this unemployed hole doing between my other two holes that are working pretty hard?”\\nI just walked around all day like, “I don’t know. That’s my big one!”\\n“God knows what he’s doing.”\\n“That’s where my faith goes.”\\nAfter I saw Music Man, I started calling it my glove compartment, but… that is another story.\\n[laughter, applause]\\nThis was my sex talk.\\nSo when I was ten, I read what sex was in a book.\\nNot planning on it. Just like, “Oh my God!”\\nTried to forget.\\nJust assaulted by Judy Blume, quite frankly.\\nThen two years later, my dad was driving me home, and out of nowhere, he goes, “Do you know what sex is?”\\nI was like, “Yeah, I read it in a book. Let’s never speak again.”\\nAnd he’s like, “All right, I need you to tell me what it is so I know you know.”\\nMy dad made me give him the sex talk!\\nI was like, “Do you know what it is?”\\nHe’s like, “Tell me what you know. Then I’ll tell you what I know.”\\n“And we’ll get to the bottom of this together.”\\nI used to ask my parents for relationship advice every time I went through a breakup.\\nDon’t. Unless you want to learn about your parents.\\nI had a terrible breakup in my early twenties.\\nI was home. My stepmom was trying to comfort me.\\nShe goes, “You know, there was a guy in my twenties I wanted to marry.”\\n“When it didn’t work out, I was devastated.”\\nI said, “I didn’t know this.”\\nAnd my dad goes, “I did! She talks about him all the time.”\\nAnd I was like, “Who was this guy? What was his deal?”\\nShe goes, “He was really cool, actually. He was an Alzheimer’s scientist.”\\nAnd my dad goes, “Notice how that’s not cured yet.”\\n[laughter]\\nShe’s like, “Wow, honey. I hope we never get Alzheimer’s.”\\nHe’s like, “I hope we do! So we can all forget about this guy.”\\nI used to be way too loose with who I asked relationship advice from.\\nPeople in the audience, total strangers.\\nI asked a couple in the front row once.\\nTwo couples therapists who had married each other.\\nI know. You ever see quadruple-stuffed Oreos?\\nAnd you’re like, “Enough.” Right?\\nThat is a hat on a hat. It’s excessive.\\nBut I was like, “Two off-duty couples therapists.”\\n“You gotta ask them.”\\nI said, “Any advice for people in relationships who are fighting a lot?”\\nThey said, “We do.”\\n“You know how a lot of people have a safe word to stop sex?”\\n“Everyone needs to have a safe word during fights.”\\nI asked a married friend, “Do you have a safe word for fights?”\\nHe was like, “What?” I’m like, “A word that stops the fight.”\\nHe goes, “We have one.”\\nI said, “What is it?”\\nHe goes, “Cunt.”\\n[audience laughing, wincing]\\n“But I have to say it. It doesn’t really work if she says it.”\\nI was like, “Jesus. I was looking for ‘pineapple, ‘ dude, but…”\\nI used to ask for relationship advice after breakups because I thought that was me working on myself, but it really wasn’t.\\nIt was me figuring out how to get into another relationship, quickly as possible.\\nSo I wouldn’t have to work on myself.\\nThe reason people don’t want to be single for long is that once you’re single for a little bit, you start to notice, “Ooh, some of the issues in my relationships are still here.”\\nAnd it’s just me now.\\nThere’s only one set of footprints in the sand.\\nAnd no one’s carrying my ass.\\nI realized in the last year I have a lot to work on.\\nI realized I’m petty in relationships.\\nI don’t wear perfume when I’m single. Don’t even think about it.\\nI wear perfume in a relationship, though.\\nBecause I know if we break up and you smell that smell later, you’ll get sad.\\nAnd that makes me happy.\\nI don’t wear perfume to smell good. I wear it to haunt you later.\\nI was on a first date with a guy.\\nI realized we both had three younger siblings.\\nI said, “Oh my God. Let’s text our sibling group chats.”\\n“Ask them what our biggest flaw is.”\\nI’m so fun on a first date. I can’t believe I’m alone.\\nHe texts his brothers, “Hey, what’s my biggest flaw?”\\nThey write back, “Works too hard.”\\n“Cares too much.”\\nOne wrote back, “Dyslexic,” which I thought was pretty funny.\\nHe couldn’t read it, but I could.\\n[audience laughs]\\nI text my siblings, “Hey, guys. What’s my biggest flaw?”\\nAnd my brother writes back immediately, “You expect everyone to hurt you, so you leave before they can.”\\nI was like, “Dude, I’m on a date right now.”\\n“Sorry! Works too hard!”\\n“I thought this was a secure line!”\\nI’m a very emotional person, very emotional partner.\\nI’m run by my emotions.\\nDid you know some people feel feelings privately?\\nHave you guys heard about this compartmentalizing bullshit?\\nSome people apparently have these polite little feelings that shuffle up to ’em during the day.\\nTug on their sleeve like, “Hello, excuse me?”\\n“I need to be felt at some point, whenever you get a chance.”\\nYou’re like, “I’m at work now.”\\n“You’re at work? I’m so sorry.”\\n“Have time later?”\\n“I get off at 6:00.”\\n“Okay, like 6:30, do you have time to feel abandoned and worthless?”\\n“Okay, 6:30 in the parking lot. It’s a date.”\\n“I love you so much. You’re doing great at work. Bye.”\\nThat’s never happened to me.\\nEvery feeling I have demands to be felt immediately.\\nEvery feeling I have demands its own parade.\\nEvery feeling I have turns into that scene from Aladdin where he’s pretending to be a prince. Just like…\\n♪ OMG, Taylor’s hungry! ♪\\n♪ This could get dicey ♪\\n♪ Needs a sandwich now She’s a bitch, take it from me ♪\\nBut I’m glad I’ve had this year to work on this stuff because I needed it.\\nI turned 30 two weeks ago.\\n[cheering]\\nAnd that means… Thank you.\\nAnd that means that I h',\n",
       "  'ave spent the last 14 years of my life trying to get good at this, trying to get good at stand-up.\\nTrying to have the career that I am now fortunate enough to have, thanks to all of you, honestly. Yeah.\\n[cheering, applause]\\nAnd as grateful as I am, and as lucky as I am, it has really made me, this year especially, go, “Oh no.”\\nI don’t know if I’m gonna be good at this other stuff.\\nI… I mean, I know I’m a good comedian.\\nI don’t know if I’m a good person, a good parent, a good partner.\\nThis hour of material that I’m doing right now, that’s like, “Can I have it all? I don’t even know!”\\nThis is not a bit, DC.\\nI am genuinely concerned.\\nI know how hard it is to do this job in this business and have a family.\\nI see how hard friends of mine work.\\nI also see how little work people put into it.\\nLot of people in this business are like, “You can have kids and travel!”\\n“They got FaceTime now.”\\nWhich feels like tying your dog outside a shop.\\n“I can see him through the window. He’s okay.”\\nI still have childhood shit I’m working through on my own.\\nI don’t want to put that on a kid, right?\\nLike, I was watching a TED Talk recently…\\nSorry, I was watching a TikTok recently. I always get those confused.\\nThe information’s still good. It’s just vertical.\\n…that said, if you have childhood trauma you’re working through, you need to learn how to parent yourself as a grown-up.\\nSo I’ve been trying to do that to heal, trying to parent myself.\\nBut I feel like I got pregnant with me in high school.\\nAnd I was not ready for this responsibility.\\nAnd now I wake up every morning, totally overwhelmed, trying not to shake me.\\nLike, okay…\\n“If I let you watch TikTok on my phone for 30 minutes, will you please stop crying?!”\\nMy friends are like, “You okay?”\\nI’m like, “No, I think I have colic. I kept me up all night.”\\nI love TikTok. You know what’s funny about TikTok?\\nThese kids are like lip-syncing, dancing, pretending they’re in a music video.\\nWe all did that growing up, didn’t we?\\nYeah! Alone in your room in the mirror, hairbrush. Of course.\\nBut if anyone had walked in on you doing it, you would’ve killed yourself, right?\\n[laughter, applause]\\nAnd these kids are online like, “I hope millions of people see this.”\\nIt’s like, “You could benefit from some bullying, I think.”\\n“Might’ve… overcorrected a bit.”\\nI do have a lot of friends who are getting married and having kids. They’re…\\nLook, they’re condescending as hell.\\nIt’s so funny how the same girls who used to wake up drunk on train tracks are like, “I dunno how you stay out past 10:00 p.m. Your lifestyle’s really unhealthy.”\\nI’m like, “I’ve seen you snort coke off a rusty bike rack.”\\n“But you keep sniffing that baby’s head like we all forgot.”\\nBut my friends who have kids and are married, they complain about their jobs, and I do the same dismissive thing right back to them where I’m like, “Yeah, but you’re married, so you’re fine.”\\nThey’re like, “But I’m miserable 60 hours of the week.”\\nI’m like, “But you have your dream dick, so you’re fine.”\\nAnd it’s not great, and I think part of it is that we’re all turning 30.\\nAnd 30 was this age in our heads where, like…\\n“Well, by 30, we’ll have all our shit together, right?”\\nThat kept us going through our twenties.\\n“We’re 25, and we’re garbage, but in five years, we’ll have it all figured out.”\\nThen, “I’m 27. I’m just a piece of shit, but I have three years to turn this around.”\\nAnd then you’re like, “I’m 29. Crunch time, bitch!”\\nAnd now that we’re all 30, we’re like, “Oh shit, our lives are not going exactly as we always pictured them.”\\nAnd so now there’s this weird comparing that’s going on, this weird tension.\\nLike, I know that all of my friends both pity and envy me.\\nJust like I know that I both pity and envy them, right?\\nI know my friends look at me and go, “I’d probably focus on work if I was all alone.”\\nAnd I go, “I’d probably have a bunch of kids if I had no talent.”\\nSo we’re all…\\n[laughter, applause]\\nAnd it’s not healthy, per se.\\nBut I do think it’s good to focus on what is going right in your life.\\nI think that that’s gratitude. I think that that’s important.\\nIt has gotten me through a lot of weddings and baby showers, to have my dream job, to sit in the back row like, “Whatever, have your bullshit love party.”\\n“Hope it works out.”\\n“I’m gonna have the coolest job of anybody you know.”\\nAnd that was true until somebody married an astronaut.\\n[audience laughs]\\nAnd everybody’s so impressed.\\nI guess astronaut beats everything.\\nThey’re like, “You’ve gotta admit, that’s the coolest.”\\nAnd I’m like, “He’s got to wear a costume or he’ll die?”\\nFuck off. That’s a dumb job.\\n“No. If I can’t breathe somewhere, I don’t go there, Dan.”\\n“That’s just science.”\\nDan hasn’t even been to space.\\nHe just goes to work and “practices space.”\\nThat’s his job.\\nThey put him in a rollercoaster. “Don’t throw up.”\\nHe’s like, “You got it!”\\nWhat a hero.\\n[laughter]\\nI’m not proud, but I told the girl that married him, “You better hope he never does go to space.”\\nShe goes, “Why? It’s dangerous?”\\nI said, “No, ’cause he’s gonna cheat on you up there.”\\nOh, you don’t think astronauts are cheating?\\nThey’re in space for months, floating.\\nHow long before one of them looks at each other like, “Hey, you know what we should try?”\\n[laughter]\\n“Houston, we have a problem. Not a big one. It’s medium.”\\n“It’s not small or anything.”\\nWhat happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. What happens on the moon never happened.\\nWe faked that landing.\\nThat’s a joke. We didn’t.\\nThere were no female astronauts back then.\\n[laughter]\\nBut if any of the relationships in my twenties had worked out, I would not have my dream job.\\nI would not have the career I’ve always wanted.\\nI’ve had a lot of cool experiences this year as a result of being on my own.\\nI finally got to do some shows in Europe in April, which was a dream come true.\\nAnd because I was single, instead of taking someone I was dating, I took Courtney.\\nCourtney’s been my best friend since we were 10.\\nTwenty years, she’s seen me through everything.\\nShe saw me through depression in high school.\\nShe saw my first stand-up show ever.\\nI called off an engagement a few years ago.\\nShe kept my wedding dress in her attic like it was Jumanji.\\nI’m like, “Just put this where I can’t hear the drums.”\\nShe and I got to run around Europe, paying for shit with my dick joke money.\\nIt was awesom',\n",
       "  'e.\\n[audience cheering]\\nYeah.\\nAnd it was really special to have her on that trip with me.\\nBecause exactly a year before that, last, last April, I was alone in a green room in Colorado, pre-show.\\nPost-some breakup.\\nI got a call from Courtney.\\n“I thought you were on vacation with your boyfriend.”\\nShe goes, “Yeah, we are, but I just wanted to check in.”\\n“That’s so nice.” And I talked to her about me for like 10, 15 minutes.\\nFinally, I was like, “You’re not saying anything about you and your trip.”\\n“I mean, are you guys okay?”\\nShe goes, “Oh my God. Yes. Oh, yeah.”\\n“No, we’re great. We’re great. We’re actually, um…”\\n“We are actually engaged.”\\nI was like, “What? Oh my God! Why did you ask about me at all?”\\nShe goes, “I just wanted to make sure you were in a place where you could hear it.”\\n[audience laughing]\\nIt was so sweet and so hurtful.\\nI… I have never felt so seen and so insulted in my whole life.\\nHer fiancé was there the whole time.\\nShe’s like, “And then what else?”\\n“She sounds stable. She sounds like she can handle it.”\\nThat’s how you know your best friend’s met the one, when you can no longer get them on the phone alone.\\nYou call them late, crying. Halfway, they’re like, “By the way, you don’t care that Todd’s been here the whole time, right?”\\nYou’re like, “No, I actually called to see if Todd thinks I have a yeast infection.”\\n[through gritted teeth] “So glad Todd is available!”\\nDon’t get me wrong.\\nI love my best friend’s fiancé. He’s amazing.\\nIf he died, would a little part of me go, “Sleepover”?\\nOf course!\\nBut I was touched that she was thinking about me and my mental health during her engagement that I went out on stage, and I said, “Before we start the show, can you guys do me a favor?”\\n“Can we make a video for my best friend?”\\nThe crowd’s like, “Yeah!” Got my phone, put it on selfie mode.\\nAnd I went, “One, two, three! Congratulations, Courtney!”\\nMe and 2,000 people, yelling it for her.\\nI got offstage that night, and I texted her the video.\\nTo say, “Hey, I love you. I’m so happy for you.”\\n“And look at all these people who pay to see me!”\\n“I’m doing just fine.”\\n“I have one of Hugh Jackman’s gloves.”\\nThank you so much, DC. You were absolutely amazing. Thank you, guys. Seriously.\\n[“Boys Wanna Be Her” playing]\\nThank you so, so much. You guys were fantastic.\\n[audience cheering]\\nDoes anyone think they have a weird sleep tip? Super weird.\\nWow. We got a confident hand right here.\\nWhat do you got?\\n[faintly] Sleep in a different city!\\nSleep in a different city?\\nBitch, do you know what my job is?\\nSleep in a different city?!\\nKnow your audience.\\nWhat else we got? That was not a strong start.\\nAnybody else… have anything?\\nIt’s okay if nobody does. We do right here.\\n[audience member] Get a very firm MaxCoil mattress.\\nGet a very firm mattress.\\nOkay, do we need to hear the instructions again?\\nIf you think you have a weird sleep tip that I have never heard of, raise your hand and tell me.\\nIf no one has anything, that’s completely fine.\\nWe have one hand over here. What have we got, glasses?\\n[audience member in glasses] A cat plus Xanax.\\nCat and Xanax.\\nIf you think… that I don’t have Xanax, this is your first show with me.\\nOkay. Well, if nobody else thinks… Look, it’s fine.\\nOkay, what about here? Right here.\\nFour-seven-eight rhythmic breathing.\\nWhat is it?\\nFour-seven-eight rhythmic breathing.\\nRhythmic breathing.\\nOkay, you guys, I’m gonna be honest. Y’all shat the bed on this one.\\nThese were some basic answers.\\nUm, and that’s okay.\\nWhat? Did someone say, “read a book”? I’m gonna fuck you up after the show.\\nMeet me in the parking lot. Read a book?\\nOh my God.\\nOkay, right here. It’s crazy that people are getting more confident as they hear other people’s terrible answers.\\nThey’re like, “I can beat firm mattress, surely.”\\nWhat have you got, second row?\\nVicks on your back.\\nWhat’s on your back?\\nVicks.\\nVicks on your back?\\nThese are not good, you guys.\\nThank you for playing.
